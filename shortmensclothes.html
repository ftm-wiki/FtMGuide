If you happen to live in an area that serves populations of shorter men (this is not uncommon in large cities), your choices might be plentiful. But if not, you might need to do some extra research and/or order clothing through mail order or the internet.</p><p>This section includes contact information for companies that specialize in clothing for shorter men, as well as hints for finding smaller sizes in popular chain department stores, clothing stores, and internet sites.</p><hr><p><strong><a name="measurements"></a>Finding your measurements</strong><br>  Most men's clothing (unlike women's) tends to be sized according to your physical measurements, including waist size and inseam length for pants or chest size, sleeve length, and neck size for shirts.</p><p>You can have your measurements taken at a menswear store (this is especially recommended when you are shopping for a suit), or you can measure yourself at home with a cloth tape measure and the help of a friend. </p><p>Take your measurements while undressed or in lightweight clothing. For best results, have a friend take the measurements. Stand up straight when measuring, and keep the tape measure snug but not tight. For clothing sold in the U.S., measurements should be taken in inches.</p><p><strong>Sleeve length measurement: </strong>Relax your arm, and place your hand on your hip with your elbow at a 90-degree angle. Start at the middle of the back of your neck, measure over your shoulder and elbow, and down your arm to your wrist bone. Or, take a shirt that fits you very well, fold at the elbow to 90 degrees, and measure from the middle back of the collar to the cuff.</p><p><strong>Neck measurement: </strong>Measure just above the base of the neck, placing two fingers between your neck and the tape measure. Or, take a shirt that fits your neck very well and measure from the center of the button to the far end of the buttonhole. Neck measurements are recorded in half-inch increments; if you are between measurements, round up to the nearest half-inch (example: of your neck measures 16.25&quot;, round up to 16.5&quot;). Remember that when you are wearing a dress shirt, you should always be able to slip an index finger comfortably into your collar when the shirt is buttoned all the way to the top. This ensures that the collar will not be too tight.</p><p><strong>Chest measurement: </strong>Measure around your chest just under your arms, around the fullest part of your chest and shoulder blades. If you have not had chest surgery and are binding, take your chest measurement while wearing the binder you would normally wear, and then measure around the fullest part of the chest.</p><p><strong>Waist measurement: </strong>Measure around where you normally wear the waist of your pants, keeping the tape measure a bit loose or putting one finger between your body and the tape measure. For suit pants, the waist is measured higher up than you would measure for a pair or jeans or chinos, as suit pants are to be worn higher. See the chapter &quot;<a href="suits.html">Suits and Ties for the Beginner</a>&quot; on this web site for more information on suit measurements and sizing.</p><p><strong>Inseam measurement:</strong> Measure from your crotch to your ankle, or to the place on your leg or foot that you want your pants to rest while you are standing. It helps to wear shoes for this measurement, so you can get an idea of where you want the pants to fall over your shoes. You can also take a pair of good fitting pants, and measure from the crotch seam to the bottom of the pants. </p><p><strong><a name="noteont"></a>A note about testosterone and clothing size</strong><br>  If you are in the beginning stages of testosterone therapy, remember that your body shape can change pretty dramatically during the first year or so, due to fat redistribution and increased muscle mass. Your shoulders and neck might get wider, your hips and butt narrower, and your belly bigger.</p><p>Even though it might be tempting for the newly transitioning man to rush out and buy a new wardrobe, it may not be wise to invest a great deal of money in clothing that might not fit in a few months. You may want to buy only a few new items as you need them, or look into used clothing as your body transitions.</p><p>If you know other trans men in your area or through internet communities, you could try &quot;handing down&quot; or exchanging clothing, as many trans men go through a few size changes during transition.</p><p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p><hr><p><strong><a name="tips"></a>Tips on sizing and fit </strong></p><p><strong><a name="sizepants"></a>Sizing in pants</strong><br>  Measurements on men's pants are usually listed with the waist measurement first, followed by the inseam measurement. So a 30x32 jean would have a 30-inch waist and a 32-inch inseam.</p><p>The &quot;rise&quot; on a pair of pants or jeans refers to the distance between the crotch and the waist. For shorter men, the rise of standard cut pants is often too long, causing the crotch to hang too low, or causing the wearer to have to pull the pants up too high on his waistline. Pants that are made especially for short men tend to have a shorter rise that is in proportion to the rest of the measurements. The rise will vary among different brands and styles, so be sure to try on pants to make sure they look good on your particular body shape.</p><p>Some of the &quot;low rise&quot; jeans styles available at stores that carry shorter inseams (see <a href="#jeans">jeans</a> listings below) might be worth a try to see if the shorter rise flatters your body type. What is a very &quot;low rise&quot; on a taller guy might look perfect on a shorter guy (if he can find a short enough inseam or have the pants hemmed).</p><p><strong><a name="sizeshirts"></a>Sizing in shirts</strong><br>  Most men's shirts that are simply labeled &quot;small&quot; (but don't necessarily have specific measurements listed on the package or label) usually are around the ballpark of a 14-14.5 inch collar, a 34-36 inch chest, and a &quot;regular&quot; sleeve length of 32-33 inches. &quot;Short&quot; sleeve lengths of 30-31 are sometimes available. Of course, the exact measurements of a men's size &quot;small&quot; will vary among manufacturers-- you might find that some brands of small are larger or cut differently than others.</p><p>Men's dress shirts will be typically be sized with specific measurements for neck circumference and sleeve length, with the neck measurement listed first. The chest/waist size ratio of most dress shirts is determined by the manufacturer to be in proportion to the neck size. This can be a challenge in fitting for guys who are short and heavy. Dress shirts can be found in &quot;regular&quot; fit, as well as &quot;athletic&quot; or &quot;trim&quot; fit (with a slight taper toward the waist, for those with broader shoulders and a thin waistline) and &quot;full cut&quot; for those who need a little more room around the middle. </p><p><strong><a name="rightfit"></a>Getting the right fit</strong><br>  Keep in mind that some stores may have their own special fit charts and size tips. This is particularly good to check when shopping online or through catalogs. It's always a good idea to consult sizing charts, ask questions if you are unsure, and find out the return policy in case something doesn't fit as you hoped.</p><p>Clothes are designed with different cuts and styles that flatter some body types and not others-- just because a shirt or pair of pants is made with your measurements doesn't mean it is going to look good on you! Try clothes on to be sure. This is especially true if you are trying to find clothes to take emphasis away from wide hips or narrow shoulders. See the next section on <a href="#types">style tips for short men</a> for specific tips on fitting short men. </p><p>Finally, don't forget the option of alterations by a tailor or by someone you know with sewing skills. If you are just a little shorter than the average sized pant length available in your area, pants can be easily hemmed to the correct length. Sleeves can also be shortened, though for a good dress shirt you might want to check a short man's specialty store to obtain a better overall fit.</p><p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p><hr><p><strong><a name="smallsizes"></a>Finding smaller sizes </strong><br>  Once you have your measurements in hand, check your local yellow pages and call around to see what stores carry clothing in your size. Don't be afraid to ask about smaller sizes! Sometimes the shirt or pants you want are available in a smaller size and simply need to be ordered for you.</p><p><strong><a name="boys"></a>Shopping in the youth/boy's department</strong><br>  Some smaller men can find clothing--especially casual items such as t-shirts, tank tops, shorts, athletic wear, etc .-- in youth/boy's departments. A youth size shirt in Large (14-16) or XL (18-20) might fit a small man perfectly. Also, the sleeve length on boys' shirts tends to be shorter, which may fit better on some.</p><p>The boy's department is also a good place to look for accessories such as socks, belts, winter gloves and hats, and baseball caps.</p><p>One word of caution: sometimes items in the boy's department are not made with the same quality and durability as men's clothing, though on the upside they are often less expensive than men's clothing. For high-quality shirts and accessories, you will be better off trying a short men's specialty store. </p><p><strong><a name="shirts"></a>Shirts</strong><br>  The Gap ( <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-2883356-10415271" target="_top" onmouseover="window.status='http://www.gap.com';return true;" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true;">Gap.com</a> <img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2883356-10415271" width="1" height="1" border="0"/>) carries shirts in extra-small men's sizes (this includes t-shirts, button-down shirts, long-sleeve t-shirts, sweaters, etc.).

This is done, in part, by creating a straight, streamlined silhouette. In general, clothing should not be baggy or otherwise ill-fitting; you want to create a clean &quot;straight up-and-down&quot; line with little interruptions, as this adds the illusion of length.</p><p>Another problem with baggy and ill-fitting clothing on a shorter man is that it ends up making you look like you are swimming in your clothes, as though you borrowed them from your larger brother or uncle. Of course, this also tends to make you look shorter as well.</p><p><strong>Pants</strong><br>For all pants, including jeans, make sure your pants are hemmed to the proper length so that they break only slightly. The term &quot;break&quot; refers to where your pants fall on your shoes, creating a horizontal crease in the fabric across the front of your pant leg. If the break comes too high or is not defined enough, your pants will look too short when you stand or walk. If the break is too low, there will be a lot of excess fabric around your ankles, and your pants will look oversized-- this can especially be a problem for shorter men. A slight/short break is the best choice for shorter men. If you also happen to have smaller feet, a slight break will keep your pants from &quot;drowning&quot; your shoes. Jeans can break slightly lower than dress pants-- but one should still avoid lots of excess material around the ankles. </p><p>Cuffing jeans or other pants makes the legs appear shorter-- have your pants hemmed to the proper length as described above. Avoid white or light-colored shoes with jeans, as this breaks the overall line of the leg.</p><p>As mentioned in the &quot;<a href="#sizepants">sizing in  pants</a>&quot; section above, another thing to consider when choosing pants is the &quot;rise&quot;-- the distance between the crotch and the waist. If the crotch of your pants hangs too low, the legs will again appear shorter, and the area around your seat and crotch will look odd or boxy. Look for low-rise (or short-sized) jeans, or have a tailor alter the crotch of dress pants if it is too long. </p><p>In dress pants and khakis, pleats should be avoided, especially deep pleats. Flowing, full-cut dress or suit pants should also be avoided. Pleats can take away from your clean vertical line, and bagginess in pants can make you look like you're drowning in too-big clothing. When possible, it is generally better to stick to flat front pants and avoid lots of extra material.</p><p>In general, baggy jeans should also be avoided. Very baggy jeans will tend to make you look like you are drowning in them, making you look smaller. This is <em>not </em>to say that you should wear ultra-tight jeans, but rather that when observing fashion trends, keep overall proportion in mind, and remember that certain cuts of clothing may suit your better than others. If you do choose a relaxed or baggier cut, be sure it fits you well and is proportioned for your frame to begin with (i.e., proper rise and inseam length).</p><p><strong>Shirts</strong><br>Try to find shirts that are hemmed to rest only and inch or two below the waistline of your pants; if your shirts are longer than this, tuck them in to avoid giving the appearance of short legs. In general, button front dress shirts should always be tucked in for the same reason (in addition to the fact that it is a tidier look). Keep in mind that a tailor can alter the hem length of shirts in addition to the sleeve length for a better fit. </p><p>Avoid very baggy shirts, or shirts that puff out when you tuck them in. Look for shirts with higher armholes (to avoid extra material under the arms) and that fit properly-- neither baggy nor clinging to your torso. </p><p>Shirts and jackets with vertical stripes can add height to your look. Choose vertical stripes that are on the thinner side-- too wide and you may start to look squat, or the pattern may overpower you.</p><p>On casual shirts, a lower collar can make your neck appear longer (for example, on a polo shirt). A V-neck t-shirt can also have the effect of making your neck seem longer.</p><p><strong>Suits</strong><br>When choosing a suit, request a &quot;short&quot; cut-- short-sized suits are proportioned better for shorter men. <a href="#stores">Short men's specialty stores</a> will stock a larger selection of short suits than your average men's clothing store.</p><p>Adding a slight taper at the waist of the suit jacket can create a longer look for the legs. A two-button jacket with a relatively low stance that shows more of the tie will make the upper body appear longer. Very subtle pinstripes can emphasize length, but avoid any strong pattern that will overpower.</p><p>For suit pants, avoid cuffs; the goal is to create long lines, and cuffs interrupt the line. As with all pants, make sure the rise on your suit pants is short enough, and avoid pleats and excessive bagginess. Keep your pants streamlined, like the rest of your silhouette. </p><p>Match the color of your belt and shoes to your pants for an even longer look-- a monochromatic color scheme creates an uninterrupted line. </p><p><strong>Ties</strong><br>  Most men's neckties are proportioned (in both length and width) to fit average-height or taller men. Typical sizes are between 58 and 60 inches in length and about 4 inches in width. </p><p>For shorter men, a tie of length of 54&quot; to 56&quot; usually fits well. A narrower tie width also usually looks more proportional on a short man-- too wide a tie ends up making a short man appear smaller and stout. Look for ties that are between 2.5&quot; to 3.25&quot; wide at their widest point. </p><p><a href="#top">back to the top</a> </p><hr><p><strong><a name="links"></a>Additional Links</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.shortmenstyle.com"><strong>Shortmenstyle.com</strong></a><br>   An updated, expanded, and easier-to-navigate version of the information found on this page, <a href="http://www.shortmenstyle.com">www.shortmenstyle.com</a> is a new project devoted to more frequent updates and detailed postings on clothing for short men. </p><p><a href="http://shortshrifted.com"><strong>Shortshrifted.com</strong><br></a>An excellent blog/resource concerning clothing and style for short men.
