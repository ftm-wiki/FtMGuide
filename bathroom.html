  </a><a href="#stppacker">Standing to Pee: STP Packers </a></p>
<p><strong><a name="intro"></a>Introduction<br>
</strong>For many trans men, using the men's room for the first time is a big step in the 
  transition process. This section provides information on using the men's room 
  safely, as well as on methods and products that can be used to urinate while 
  standing. This includes devices that serve as both a packer and as a stand-to-pee 
(STP) device.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that certain genital surgeries can include a procedure 
  called a &quot;urethral hookup&quot; or &quot;urethral lengthening,&quot; which allows the recipient to urinate through 
  his surgically constructed penis. Details of such surgical procedures are not 
  covered in this section, but are covered in the section on <a href="grs.html">genital 
  reconstruction surgery</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="mensroom"></a>Men's Room Etiquette<br>
</strong>While women's restrooms often involve social interaction and keen observation 
  among the women who use them, men's restrooms are usually more &quot;down to 
  business.&quot; That is, most guys in the men's room don't look at one another 
  for more than a second (if at all), there usually isn't much chatting going 
  on, and the vast majority of men aren't scrutinizing carefully who is using 
  the bathroom at any particular time. This is a bonus for those in early stages 
  of transition, as most men won't be looking for small details to see if you 
  &quot;belong&quot; there or not. If you are being read fairly consistently as 
  a man (or as a boy if you appear younger), and walk into a men's room with confidence 
and purpose, you probably will not raise any eyebrows.</p>
<p>Most men's rooms will have a combination of urinals and stalls, or at the very 
  least one stall (we've all got to sit down at least once in a while to take 
  a crap). Most stalls will have doors on them, so you can do your business in 
  private if you need to. Not all men stand to pee, and even if they do, some 
  men prefer to use a closed stall while standing to pee, rather than using a 
  urinal. So if you haven't mastered a stand-to-pee device for use at a urinal, 
  or simply don't want to use one, you can feel fine using a stall and sitting down. If you feel self-conscious 
  about sitting to pee, you can spend a little extra time in the stall as if you 
  were taking a crap.</p>
<p>Another thing you might notice when using the men's room is 
    that there is a lot less inhibition than in women's rooms about grunting, farting, 
    or otherwise making noise while sitting on the toilet in the stalls. So, feel 
    free to use the stalls and not worry much about it. If you do come across a 
    stall without a door (this is rare but it happens), you may be able to drop 
    your pants and sit down quickly to avoid exposure, but do so only if you feel 
    the environment is safe.</p>
<p>If you choose to use a stand-to-pee (STP) device or have had a surgery that allows you 
  otherwise pee standing up, you may wish to use a urinal. If that is the case, 
  basic urinal etiquette should be followed. That is, if there are a row of urinals 
  available, take one that is not directly next to another guy who is already 
  peeing. If you are in a ridiculously crowded restroom (like at a large event), 
  and you absolutely must stand directly next to someone else, be sure to keep 
  your eyes forward and don't touch or bump the guy's elbow that is next to you. 
  Step up, get your business done, flush, and walk away. Don't take a peek at 
  another guy's penis, and don't make eye contact while at the urinal. If you 
  do make any eye contact in a men's room, it should be brief and only as a point 
  of acknowledgement.</p>
<p>The men's room etiquette pointers listed above are meant as basic guidelines outlining the interactions typical to most men's restrooms. Obviously some situations might be different from place to place. I have tried to err on the side of modesty with these pointers with the idea that bathrooms are a shared space where we are all literally left with our pants down-- better to play it more conservatively unless you already know the particular restroom environment is more relaxed.</p>
<p><b><a name="safety"></a>A Note on Safety</b><br>
  It should be noted that if you are not yet being read as male on a regular basis, 
  and/or if you are not feeling confident or safe about using the men's room in 
  any situation, it may be best to find another bathroom arrangement. Most men's 
  restrooms are not dangerous places, but in some circumstances it may be wise 
  to avoid potential trouble. If you are experiencing such issues around restroom 
  use, you may want to seek out a single-stall bathroom when possible, or wait 
  for either the men's or the women's room to empty out (whichever is safer and 
  more appropriate for the situation), use the facilities quickly, and move on. 
  In many situations, using the men's room will be perfectly safe-- it just pays 
  to use caution when necessary.</p>
<p><strong><a name="practice"></a>Becoming Proficient with Stand-to-Pee Devices<br>
  </strong>Using a stand-to-pee device usually takes some practice. Practice at 
  home and have it down cold before trying it in a public men's room. For your 
  first few times trying out an STP device, you may wish to practice while standing 
  undressed in the bathtub, so if you have leaks you won't mess up your clothes 
  or the floor. Once you have mastered the device in the tub, you can move on 
  to trying it while undressed in front of the toilet at home to get used to aiming 
  the device. Then try it in clothes in front of the toilet. Once you have mastered 
  the use of the device, think about how you will carry it (if it is not an STP-packer), 
  how you will discreetly put it in place, where you will put it when done, how 
  you will keep it clean, etc. In other words, before you start to use the device 
  in a public restroom, have a plan for how it will work. Do a few practice runs 
  at home. The last thing you want to do is show up at the restroom, fumble with 
  your STP device, and drop it in the toilet or in the urinal in front of you!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there is no shame in using the stalls if you don't want to 
  use an STP device-- though such devices can come in handy in situations when 
  you would prefer to stand and pee, such as dirty restrooms, travel situations, 
  or camping outdoors. Plenty of guys use the stalls, so don't feel you have to 
  stand if you don't want to.</p>

<p><strong><a name="stp"></a>STP Devices (non-packers)</strong></p>
<p><b>Coffee Can Lid/Flexible Plastic Disc<br>
  </b>This is a rather simple device that can be easily made at home. Take the 
  flexible plastic lid from a can of coffee grinds, or from a similar package 
  (like a cottage cheese container or large yogurt tub), and cut away the lip so it is flat. The lid 
  needs to be flexible enough to roll into a funnel shape or a U-shape for use. 
  Hold the funnel end/U-end far enough back so that you position it behind your 
  urethral opening. Aim the pointed end down toward the toilet bowl, and pee. 
  You will have to practice to get the hang of it. You can also experiment with 
  trimming and rolling the device in a manner that works best for you. These devices are 
  easy to carry and conceal in your back pocket, or even in a small pocket in 
  your underwear. Very fine grit sandpaper can be used to smooth out any rough 
  edges.</p>
<p><b>Medicine Spoon<br>
  </b>Medicine spoons are small, inexpensive plastic devices that can be found 
  at most pharmacies. The wider end of the spoon (the &quot;scoop&quot; end) is 
  held against you, between the labia, to create a seal around the urethral opening. 
  This is the end that you pee into. Cut off the tip at the other end (the handle 
  of the spoon) at a 45 degree angle, so that the tip points downwards when the 
  spoon end is up against you. This is the end the pee flows out of. You will 
  have to practice at home to find the correct placement for the spoon so you 
  don't have leakage. Some people trim/sand down any sharp edges they may find 
  on their medicine spoon, or may otherwise modify it to suit their needs. Very 
  fine grit sandpaper can be used to smooth out any rough edges.</p>
<p><strong>Urinall</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.urinall.co.uk/">www.urinall.co.uk</a><br>
The Urinall is a lightweight, handmade product created specifically for the FTM trans community. It is a small, hard funnel about the size of a large medicine spoon, but the edges are rounded and beveled for a comfortable fit. The Urinall comes with a length of latex tubing which can be removed or replaced. Cost is &pound;12 (that's in British pounds), which includes shipping anywhere in the world. Convert prices to U.S. dollars at <a href="http://www.xe.com/ucc/">www.xe.com/ucc</a>.</p>
<p><b>The TravelMate<br>
  </b> <a href="http://www.whenyagottago.com">www.whenyagottago.com</a><br>
  The TravelMate is a modification of the medicine spoon that was created specifically for standing to pee. It is designed to fit comfortably 
  between the labia to form a leak-free seal. It is made of soft, flexible, medical-grade 
  plastic that springs back to its original shape after being bent. Cost is $9.25.</p>
<p><strong>The PStyle</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.kristascups.com/">www.kristascups.com</a><br>
The PStyle is a long, thin, open-topped urinary device made of stiff plastic with rounded edges for user comfort. It combines the features of the coffee can lid (open top, easy to place) and the medicine spoon (stiff plastic), which may make it easier to use for some people. Because the device is stiff and fairly large, it is not easily slipped into a pocket unless you happen to be wearing baggy pants. However, its long size and stiffness can help clear the fly of pants without drips. Cost is $12, and is available in 6 colors. <strong>The PStyle is  available at the Tool Shed for $12, <a href="http://www.toolshedtoys.com/product_info.php/products_id/484">www.toolshedtoys.com</a>.</strong></p>

The Mr. Fenis is a very flexible silicone stand-to-pee device that is a cross between a tube and a funnel, and has the added quality of being molded to look like a penis. The Mr. Fenis is just less than 8 inches  long and is a bit wider than the original Fenis, though the opening in the end is small enough to create a narrow stream. The Mister Fenis can easily be folded for quick and discreet storage. Mr. Fenis is reusable and easy to clean and comfortable to use, and the silicone resists microbiological growth. Comes in four flesh tones (peach, olive, tan, and dark brown). <strong>The Mr. Fenis is  available at the Tool Shed for $25, <a href="http://www.toolshedtoys.com/product_info.php/products_id/1875">www.toolshedtoys.com</a>.</strong></p>

<p><b><a name="stppacker"></a>Stand-to-Pee (STP) Packers<br>
  </b>The products listed below are soft packers that allow a user to urinate while standing. (For more information about soft packers, see the <a href="packing.html#softpackintro">packing</a> 
  section of this web site.)</p>
<p><strong>STP-FITZ</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/stp-fitz-stp-fitz-20-stand-to-pee-packer-mr-softie.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
STP-FITZ, an FTM-owned business, retrofits soft packers into an STP packer with a silicone funnel receptacle.</p>
<p>The STP FITZ 2.0 receptacle is a design improvement over previous  "nipple" style STPs, in that the funnel is designed for better flow, and  there is no glue between the receptacle and tubing, thus eliminating  the problems some people would experience with the glue degrading over  time. The tubing/receptacle is a single unit, and made from silicone,  making it easy to clean and generally more durable.</p>
<p>STP-FITZ retrofits the Mr. Softie (i.e. Fleshlight) packer, available  in two skin tones-- vanilla (light)  and caramel (mid-tone) colors.  Unfortunately Mr. Softie is not available in a third, darker skin tone.  The Mr. Softie STP Fitz 2.0 is available in two shaft lengths: 3.5-inch  (small, $38) and 5-inch (large, $39).</p>
<p><strong>STP-FITZ packers can be purchased through the <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/stp-fitz-stp-fitz-20-stand-to-pee-packer-mr-softie.html">Tool Shed web site</a></strong>,  where a number of other products for trans men are also available--  check the "gender expression" link on the left hand page menu for a  listing. <strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web  site directly supports FTMguide.org.

  The Hugo and Tomas are both STP-compatible, 3-in-1 realistic silicone  prosthetics. The difference between the Hugo and the Tomas is that the  Tomas is hand-painted with 9 layers of extrinsic silicone color &amp;  skin tones to give finely  sculptured skin details. Hugo is produced in a  solid skin tone, but stil has the sculpted details of veins and skin  folds. Both Hugo and Tomas are fitted with a removable flexible, jointed  hard plastic insert  for use during sexual play. During everyday  packing, that insert is  removed to create the feel of a flaccid penis.  The shaft is hollowed to  allow for use as a Stand-To-Pee packer. You  can use the flexible blue  silicone STP funnel included with the Hugo or  Tomas, or you can add your own  removable funnel device that might work  better with your body. The hollowed area  behind the balls will work  with most STP funnel devices. </p>
<p><strong>Pee-Cock 3-in-1 Packer</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.peecockproducts.com">www.peecockproducts.com</a><br>
  This product, introduced in 2011, is designed to be a stand-to-pee  packer and pack-and-play model all in one. Made of soft silicone, the  shaft of the Pee-Cock has an opening throughout its length to allow for  urination. The opening through the shaft also can accommodate a flexible  "erection rod" that is inserted through the back of the packer to allow  the Pee-Cock to be used for sexual penetration. The back of the packer  is shaped like the opening of a funnel; it is pressed low and tightly  against the body over the urethral opening during urination. Due to the  shape of the funnel, the Pee-Cock may also work well for men who have  had metoidioplasty.</p>
<p>The Pee-Cock comes in three sizes, 4 inches ($129), 5.5 inches  ($139), and 6.5 inches ($149). They are in the flaccid state when worn  without the erection rod. There are 3 shades of skin tones available:  caucasian, moderate brown or dark brown. Pee-Cock Products also offers  two harnesses to wear with the Pee-Cock.</p>

  <a href="http://www.freetomprosthetics.com">www.freetomprosthetics.com</a><br>
  FreeToM Prosthetics is a Transgendered Medical Prosthesis manufacturing  company located in  Portland, Oregon. Using high quality materials and  techniques, each prosthetic is carefully handmade and is unique-- they  are molded from volunteer cis males for extra realism. All their  prosthetics are made from 100% silicone, are easy to clean and are  offered in multiple skin tones. The 2-in-1 is FreeToM's pack-and-pee  model, made from soft silicone and easy to wear all day long. They also  offer a 4-in-1, which is a pack, pee, play, and pleasure model-- this  one is a bit firmer and more difficult for easy everyday packing than  the 2-in-1.</p>
