<p><b><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</b><br>
  Most (but not all) trans men will have at least one surgical procedure in his lifetime
  related to gender transition, if not several of them. However, it is important
  to note that many trans men do not avail themselves of the surgeries listed below
  due to cost considerations, health reasons, or personal reasons. Currently,
  most surgeries related to gender transition are not covered by insurance companies,
  so costs can be prohibitive for many trans men of lower or fixed incomes.</p>
<p>FTM surgery is generally divided into three main groups:<br>
  1. <b>Chest reconstruction surgeries</b> (also referred to as &quot;top&quot; surgery or male chest contouring);<br>
  2. <b>Hysterectomy</b> and <b>oophorectomy</b> (removal of the uterus and ovaries, respectively); and<br>
  3. <b>Genital reconstruction surgeries</b> (also referred to as &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot; surgery or GRS).<br>
Within these three main groupings are different types of procedures and surgical methods that will be further described herein.</p>
<p>This particular section describes the main types of <b>surgical chest reconstruction</b>
  procedures that are currently available to trans men. <a href="hysto.html">Hysterectomy/oophorectomy</a>
  and <a href="grs.html">genital reconstruction surgeries (GRS)</a> are detailed
  in their own separate sections.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the FTM surgeries listed below are generalized. It is important
  to note that each individual surgeon may use a different technique for any given
  procedure. If you are considering any of these procedures, it is important to
  research your options thoroughly and speak candidly with the surgeons you are
  considering. That way you can choose the procedure and surgeon that best suits
  your body type, needs, and expectations.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a> </p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="crs"></a>Chest reconstruction surgery</b><br>
  Chest surgery is the most common surgical procedure sought by trans men. The goal
  of chest surgery is to create a contoured, male-looking chest. There are two
  basic procedures that are typically performed to accomplish this goal:<br>
  1. <b>Double incision/Bilateral mastectomy</b><br>
  2. <b>Keyhole/Peri-areolar incision</b></p>
<p>There are a few other surgical variations used for chest reconstruction, including
  the &quot;<b>inverted T</b>&quot; incision, the &quot;<b>pie wedge</b>&quot;
  method, and other combinations of incisions that a surgeon may see as the best
  approach for the patient. These methods are not covered in great detail here,
  as they are not nearly as common as the above two approaches, and because they
  are similar to the other approaches except for the resultant scarring. For example,
  the inverted T approach is quite similar to the double incision method except
  that the incisions run vertically down from the nipple to the bottom of the
  pectoral area, and the resulting scar ends up looking like an anchor or an upside-down
  letter &quot;T.&quot; The pie wedge method is also similar to the double incision,
  but uses a curved incision from the bottom of the nipple toward the underarm.</p>
<p>The surgical method chosen will depend on the body type of the patient and the
  skills/preferences of the surgeon. In general, guys with larger chests (cup
  size C or larger) will benefit most from the double incision method, while guys
  with smaller chests (preferably A, sometimes B) can opt for the keyhole/peri-areolar
  procedure. The inverted T or pie wedge procedures can be used on guys with medium
  sized chests (B or C); however, these procedures tend to be used less frequently
  than the other two approaches because the scarring is not always preferred (as
  compared to the double incision method).</p>
<p>It is best to discuss the options with the surgeon(s) you are considering. Whenever possible, 
  ask to see photographic samples of the surgeon's work. If you can see an example 
  of their work that shows a patient with a similar body type to yours, so much 
  the better. There is a web site (<a href="http://www.transbucket.com/">www.transbucket.com</a>) 
  that serves as a repository for FTM surgery photos and information. The site 
  can be searched by procedure type and by surgeon. Another good resource for 
  FTM surgical information and advice can be found on the FTM Surgery Info Group 
  on Yahoo (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmsurgeryinfo/">groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmsurgeryinfo</a>). 
  These can be invaluable resources when considering which surgeons and procedures 
  may be right for you. See also the <a href="#resources">resources</a> list below for further information.</p>

<p><b><a name="doubleincision"></a>Double incision/Bilateral mastectomy<br>
  </b>The double incision technique is effective for individuals with a medium
  to large amount of breast tissue (cup size C and above, often also recommended
  for cup size B). In this method, large incisions are made horizontally across
  each breast, usually below the nipple. The skin is then peeled back so that
  the mammary glands and fatty tissue can be removed with a scalpel. The muscles
  of the chest are not touched. Certain areas of harder-to-reach fatty tissue
  may also be removed via liposuction (such as areas near the armpits). Once the
  breast tissue has been removed, the excess chest skin is trimmed and the incisions
  closed, leaving two seams/scars just below the line of the pectoral muscles.</p>
<p>The techniques for treatment and placement of the nipples with the double incision
  method vary among different surgeons. Usually, the original nipples are completely
  removed, trimmed to a smaller size, and are then grafted onto the chest in a
  higher, more aesthetically-male location. Some surgeons use a &quot;pedicle&quot;
  technique, wherein the nipples are left partially attached to the body via a
  stalk of tissue. They are then repositioned in a more aesthetically-male location,
  while their connection to the body via the pedicle stalk remains intact. They
  may or may not be trimmed to a smaller size. The pedicle option is sometimes
  chosen in an attempt to maintain sensation in the nipples.</p>
<p>Occasionally, some surgeons may choose not to preserve or graft the nipples
  in any way, but this is a far less common option. If, for some reason, the nipples
  cannot be retained during the procedure, or if the nipple grafts are lost because
  of tissue death, there is an option of tattooing &quot;nipples&quot; onto the
  chest at a later date, which can have an aesthetically satisfactory outcome.
  Be sure to discuss clearly with your surgeon the methods they will be using
  for nipple placement/grafting.</p>
<p>Before the incisions are sealed, two &quot;drains&quot; consisting of long,
  thin tubing are placed along the length of each incision. The drain tubing exits
  the body through a small incision hole under each armpit, and is attached to
  a small plastic bulb on either side. The tubing/bulbs are to help drain off
  and collect excess blood/fluid so that it will not build up under the skin.
  They are left in place for several days to a week, depending on how much fluid
  continues to drain. Drains need to be periodically emptied of fluid by the patient
  (you may need a friend to help with this).</p>
<p>The surgery itself takes about 3 to 4 hours, and is done under general anesthesia.
  It is most often done on an outpatient basis, where the surgery is performed
  in the morning and the patient is sent home by mid-afternoon. Some surgeons
  may require an overnight stay. There are usually at least two post-surgical
  follow-up visits to remove drains and sutures (usually within the first week
  or so), and to check the overall healing progress of the chest. If there are
  complications, more follow-up visits may be necessary. A binder is usually worn
  for one to three weeks to aid in healing. </p>
<p>Each surgeon will provide specific instructions about follow-up care and healing
  time. In general, if you have a desk job, you'll probably need at least a couple
  of weeks off from work to allow for the body to heal. If your job requires moderate
  or heavy lifting, or frequent raising of the arms above the head, you'll probably
  need at least a month or two away from those heavy-lifting tasks. Speak to your
  surgeon about specific tasks and concerns. Do not try to go back to tasks before
  your body has had a chance to heal properly; the risk of scarring and complications
  is greatly increased if adequate healing time is not allowed.</p>
<p>The final result of the surgery usually provides for a well-contoured male
  chest, but it leaves two significant horizontal or U-shaped scars below the
  pectoral area. Examples of double incision surgery can be viewed at <a href="http://www.transbucket.com/">www.transbucket.com</a>.</p>
<p>Potential pros for the double incision method:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For guys with big chests, this is the method that provides the best results
    for a male-contoured chest.</li>
  <li>Scars, while large, are placed under the lower border of the pectoral muscles,
    so that muscle development in that area can make them slightly less noticeable.
    Chest hair growth with testosterone therapy may also cover the appearance
    of scars.</li>
  <li>This method provides for easier access to and removal of all mammary tissue,
    as compared to the keyhole procedure.</li>
  <li>Proper repositioning and resizing of nipples makes for a more male-looking
    chest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential cons for the double incision method:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prominent scars on the chest (some may also experience raised or reddened 
    scars)</li>
  <li>Partial or complete loss of nipple sensation</li>
  <li>Potential loss of nipple grafts due to tissue death</li>
  <li>Nipple placement may be uneven or not aesthetically pleasing</li>
  <li>Nipple size/appearance might not be pleasing</li>
  <li>The appearance of &quot;dog ears&quot; under the armpits (excess, protruding 
    skin at the end of the incision)</li>
  <li>Appearance of puckering along the scars</li>
  <li>Areas of numbness in the armpits due to liposuction in that area</li>
  <li>May require revision</li>
  <li>The usual risks of any surgery, including bleeding, infection, problems 
    from anesthesia, blood clots, or death (rare). </li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that many surgeons will include future revisions with the cost
  of their fee, so that imperfections such as dog ears, areas of bad scarring,
  or nipple problems can be addressed. Be sure to ask any surgeon if revisions
  are included in his or her fee. Additional costs of the surgical facilities
  and/or anesthesia, however, is usually not covered for revisions, so the patient
  may still need to pay at least some money for revisions.</p>

<p><b><a name="keyholeperi"></a>Keyhole/Peri-areolar incision<br>
  </b> The keyhole and peri-areolar techniques are effective for individuals with
  small amounts of breast tissue (cup size A or smaller is ideal; sometimes recommended
  by certain surgeons for cup size B). They are both done via incisions around
  the areola (the area of darker skin around the nipple), though the techniques
  differ slightly, as described below.</p>
<p>In the keyhole method, a small incision is made along the border of the areola
  (usually along the bottom), and the breast tissue is removed via a liposuction
  needle through the incision. The nipple is left attached to the body via a pedicle
  (a stalk of tissue) in order to maintain sensation. Once the breast tissue has
  been removed, the incision is closed. The nipple is usually not resized or repositioned.</p>
<p>In the peri-areolar method, an incision is made along the entire circumference 
  of the areola. The nipple is usually left attached to the body via a pedicle 
  in order to maintain sensation. Breast tissue is then &quot;scooped out&quot; 
  by scalpel, or with a combination of scalpel and liposuction. The areola may 
  be trimmed somewhat to reduce its size. Excess skin on the chest may also be 
  trimmed away along the circumference of the incision. The skin is then pulled 
  taut toward the center of the opening and the nipple is reattached to cover 
  the opening-- much like pulling a drawstring bag closed. Thus, this procedure 
  is also sometimes referred to as the drawstring or &quot;purse string&quot; 
  technique. The nipple/areola may be repositioned slightly, depending on original 
  chest size and the available skin.</p>
<p>Like in the double incision method, &quot;drains&quot; consisting of long,
  thin tubing may be placed in the chest to help drain off and collect excess
  blood/fluid so that it will not build up under the skin. Because there are no
  long incision lines to follow, the individual drain tubes are inserted through
  the original incision, and curved along the pectoral area, exiting the body
  through two small incision holes under the armpits. The tubing is attached to
  a small plastic bulb on either side. They are left in place for several days
  to a week, depending on how much fluid continues to drain. Drains need to be
  periodically emptied of fluid by the patient (you may need a friend to help
  with this).</p>
<p>The surgery itself takes about 3 to 4 hours (perhaps longer if there is a large
  amount of chest tissue), and is done under general anesthesia. It is most often
  done on an outpatient basis, where the surgery is performed in the morning and
  the patient is sent home by mid-afternoon. Some surgeons may require an overnight
  stay. There are usually at least two post-surgical follow-up visits to remove
  drains and sutures (usually within the first week or so), and to check the overall
  healing progress of the chest. If there are complications, more follow-up visits
  may be necessary. A binder is usually worn for one to three weeks to aid in
  healing.</p>
<p>Each surgeon will provide specific instructions about follow-up care and healing
  time. In general, if you have a desk job, you'll probably need at least a couple
  of weeks off from work to allow for the body to heal. If your job requires moderate
  or heavy lifting, or frequent raising of the arms above the head, you'll probably
  need at least a month or two away from those heavy-lifting tasks. Speak to your
  surgeon about specific tasks and concerns. Do not try to go back to tasks before
  your body has had a chance to heal properly; the risk of scarring and complications
  is greatly increased if adequate healing time is not allowed.</p>
<p>The final result of the surgery does not leave significant visible scarring.
  Examples of keyhole and peri-areolar surgery can be viewed at <a href="http://www.transbucket.com/">www.transbucket.com</a><a href="http://www.transster.com"></a>.
  Revision with this type of surgery is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Potential pros of keyhole/peri-areolar:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minimal scarring</li>
  <li>Retention of sensation in the nipples</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential cons of keyhole/peri-areolar:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nipple placement may not be ideal</li>
  <li>Chest may not appear completely flat (i.e., may appear to be a breast reduction 
    rather than a flat, male chest), depending on skin retraction and/or leftover/uneven 
    fatty tissue</li>
  <li>Risk of nipple loss due to liposuction trauma of surrounding tissue</li>
  <li>Numbness from liposuction</li>
  <li>Insufficient retraction of remaining skin, leaving sagging or puckering 
    areas</li>
  <li>Puckering around the scar in peri-areolar technique</li>
  <li>May require revision</li>
  <li>The usual risks of any surgery, including bleeding, infection, problems 
    from anesthesia, blood clots, or death (rare).</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that many surgeons will include future revisions with the cost
  of their fee, so that imperfections such as nipple problems, uneven tissue,
  or puckering can be addressed. Be sure to ask any surgeon if revisions are included
  in his or her fee. Additional costs of the surgical facilities and/or anesthesia,
  however, is usually not covered for revisions, so the patient may still need
  to pay at least some money for revisions.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="costs"></a>Costs for chest reconstruction</b><br>
  In the United States, one can expect to pay between $1,500 and $8,500 for chest
  surgery, depending on the surgeon's fee, cost of the surgical facility, the
  cost of the anesthesiologist, and other miscellaneous expenses (tissue pathology
  tests, aftercare visits, travel and hotel stay, etc.). As mentioned in the introduction,
  gender reconstruction-related surgeries are typically not covered by insurance
  companies in the U.S., so these costs must often be paid out of pocket by the patient.</p>
<p>Some patients may be able to seek out lower surgical fees by traveling abroad for surgery (though the cost of travel and lodging must also be factored in to the final figure). There are skilled surgeons in a number of countries, and by using resources such as <a href="http://www.transbucket.com/">www.transbucket.com</a><a href="http://www.transster.com/"></a>, you can view examples of FTM surgical work from all over the world. No matter the surgeon you are considering, research your options carefully, and remember that while cost is obviously very important, it may not be the only factor when making your final decision. </p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<hr>
<p><a name="presurgery"></a><b>Pre-surgical advice</b><br>
  One of the main keys to an optimal surgical outcome is the overall health and 
  fitness of the patient going into surgery. Two factors that are often considered 
  important before a chest surgery procedure (besides overall good health) are 
  smoking and excess body weight.</p>
<p>Smoking slows the ability of the body to heal itself after surgery; thus, it 
  is usually recommended that patients who smoke avoid smoking for at least two 
  weeks prior to surgery, if at all possible. It is not necessary, but highly recommended.</p>
<p>As for the issue of excess body weight: while there is no reason why an individual
  who is overweight cannot undergo surgery if he is otherwise healthy, the aesthetic
  result of chest reconstruction is dramatically improved if the patient is near
  optimal body weight at the time of the procedure. This allows the surgeon to
  accurately contour the chest in a manner proportionally correct for that individual,
  lessening the chance of &quot;dog ears&quot; under the armpits, and improving
  the chance for overall symmetry.</p>
<p>However, if a patient cannot foresee losing weight before the procedure, or 
  simply chooses not to lose weight, he should be able to proceed if he is in 
  otherwise good health. Some surgeons are more willing to work with patients 
  with larger chests and excess body weight than others. Speak to the surgeons 
  you are considering if you have weight concerns.</p>
<p>Other, specific pre-surgical advice will be provided to you by your surgeon. 
  Typically, you will be asked to discontinue use of aspirin, ibuprofen, and other 
  blood-thinning medications during the 10 days prior and up to the surgical date. 
  You may also be asked to discontinue use of other medications; be sure to discuss 
  any medications you are taking-- including supplements-- with your surgeon.</p>
<p>There are certain vitamins and supplements that are said to help benefit in 
  the healing process. You may wish to research this topic and outline a nutritional 
  regimen for both before and after surgery to aid your body's natural healing 
  process. However, taking supplements or vitamins is not necessary for a positive 
  surgical outcome.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<hr>
<p><a name="scarring"></a><b>Scarring</b><br>
  Scarring is a risk with any surgery. The degree of scarring will vary depending
  on the type of procedure and techniques of the surgeon, the amount of tension
  on the incisions as they heal, and the genetic makeup of the patient.</p>
<p>The body makes scar tissue in the natural process of healing itself from a wound. During
  the first several weeks after surgery, collagen accumulates at the scar site. This process tends to create temporarily
  raised and sometimes darkened scars. After this initial healing period, the scars begin
  to mature and become less prominent over time, usually flattening and fading
  in color over a period of months and years.</p>
<p>Sometimes, scars remain thickened and quite red. This is called hypertrophic 
  scarring, and it occurs in some patients. It may simply be due to heredity, 
  or from incisions that have been unduly stretched during the healing process 
  (if, for example, a patient reaches frequently above his head during the healing 
  process, this may pull at the scar tissue). Speak directly with your surgeon 
  about ways to minimize scarring.</p>
<p>If hypertrophic scarring occurs, there are post-operative scar treatments available 
  to address the problem. These products include topical Vitamin E oils or lotions, 
  topical products such as <a href="http://www.mederma.com/">Mederma</a>, <a href="http://www.hansonmedical.com/scarfade/">Scar 
  Fade</a>, and <a href="http://www.scarease.com/">ScarEase</a>, silicone gel 
  creams, or re-usable silicone sheeting. These scar remedies may work for some 
  patients and not others.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that scars will look their worst at about six weeks post-operative,
  and will fade and become less noticeable in the upcoming months and years. If
  you have an area of particularly bad scarring, you may wish to consult with
  your surgeon about possible revisions.</p>
