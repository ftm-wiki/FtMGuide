Until the advent of   mass drug manufacturing in the 1950s, compounding was the way virtually all pharmacists   practiced. In the 1930s and 1940s, approximately 60% of all medications were   compounded, as opposed to about 1% today.</p><p>Today, compounding pharmacies specialize mainly in the preparation of medicines   that are customized to meet the needs of specific patients. This includes preparing   medicines for patients who have allergies to certain ingredients found in mass-produced   drugs; liquid versions of solid medicines to make them easier to swallow; flavored   medicines for children; cream or gel-based versions of a medication for topical   application (as well as other delivery methods); medicines that have been discontinued   by a manufacturer; or medicines of a different dosage or concentration than   that which is typically available. Compounding pharmacies allow for more flexibility,   options, and customization than are typically available from pharmaceutical   companies.</p><p><b><a name="howmight"></a>How might compounding benefit me with regard to testosterone   therapy?<br>  </b> Some individuals might find that they respond well to a prescription of   Delatestryl (injectable testosterone enanthate), but that they experience an   allergic reaction to the sesame oil in which it is suspended. A compounding   pharmacy can suspend testosterone enanthate in a different oil to help avoid   such an allergic reaction. Testosterone topical creams (as opposed to the widely available alcohol-based gels that are mass-produced by pharmaceutical companies) can also be mixed by compounding pharmacies as specified by your doctor's prescription.   Compounding pharmacies can also create sublingual testosterone formulations   or other modified delivery systems according to your specific needs.</p><p>As with anything related to your health care, discuss your prescription options   with your doctor and pharmacist to find out if the compounding option is right   for you.</p><p><b><a name="safety"></a>Is compounding safe?<br>  </b> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that compounded prescriptions are ethical and legal   as long as they are prescribed by a licensed practitioner for a specific patient   and are compounded by a licensed pharmacist. The bulk drug substances used in   a compounded medicine must qualify for use in compounding either via FDA-approved   lists or via a listing in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia National Formulary (USP/NF),   published by an independent standard-setting organization. Previously marketed   drugs that have been found to be unsafe or ineffective and have been removed   from the market may not be compounded. </p><p>Because compounding pharmacies mix ingredients in small batches in-house, there   has been some inquiry as to whether compounded medicines are as safe as their   pharmaceutical company counterparts. Pharmaceutical companies are regulated   by the FDA and must meet strict facility and   quality control standards to ensure that their products are safe and that each batch   is consistent. Compounding pharmacies are regulated by state boards of pharmacy;   thus, each state will have a different set of standards.</p><p>In general, the quality control and regulation of pharmaceutical manufacturers   is better than that of compounding pharmacies. Of course, it is important to   keep in mind that many compounding pharmacies are very responsible regarding   quality control practices and laboratory technique, and the medicines produced   in those facilities can be quite safe. However, for the consumer, safety and   purity are of special consideration when obtaining prescription drugs such as   injectables.</p><p>When choosing a compounding pharmacy, you may wish to inquire about the specific   standards, testing, raw materials, and quality control practices that the pharmacy   uses to ensure the safety and quality of their medications.</p><p><b><a name="insurance"></a>Are compounded drugs covered by insurance?<br>  </b> Unlike manufactured drug products, compounded medications are exempt by   law from having National Drug Code ID numbers. Because of this, some insurance   companies will not directly reimburse compounding pharmacists. However, many   insurance plans allow patients to send in claim forms for reimbursement. Check   with your insurance plan, and ask your compounding pharmacist to provide you   with a universal claim form.</p><p><b><a name="where"></a>Where can I find a compounding pharmacy?<br>  </b> The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists (IACP) maintains a   referral service on their web site: <a href="http://www.iacprx.org">www.iacprx.org</a>.   They can also be reached by telephone at 800-927-4227.</p><p>A number of trans men have recommended the following compounding pharmacies for   mail-order of testosterone:<br>  Apothecure pharmacy (<a href="http://www.apothecure.com">www.apothecure.com</a>)<br>Strohecker's pharmacy (<a href="http://www.stroheckersrx.com">www.stroheckersrx.com</a>)</p><p><a href="ttypes.html">Back to &quot;Testosterone Types and Delivery&quot;</a> </p><p><strong><span class="style1">Was this page helpful to you?</span><br>Please consider <a href="donate.html">donating</a> to ftmguide.org! </strong> </p><p><a href="index.html">Back to Hudson's FTM Resource Guide main page</a></p><p><a href="copyright.html">Copyright, disclaimer, and privacy information</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
