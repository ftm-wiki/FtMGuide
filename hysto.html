<p><b><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</b><br>
  Most (but not all) trans men will have at least one surgical procedure in his lifetime
  related to gender transition, if not several of them. However, it is important
  to note that many trans men do not avail themselves of the surgeries listed below
  due to cost considerations, health reasons, or personal reasons. Currently,
  most surgeries related to gender transition are not covered by insurance companies,
  so costs can be prohibitive for many trans men of lower or fixed incomes.</p>
<p>FTM surgery is generally divided into three main groups:<br>
  1. <b>Chest reconstruction surgeries</b> (also referred to as &quot;top&quot;
  surgery or male chest contouring);<br>
  2. <b>Hysterectomy</b> and <b>oophorectomy</b> (removal of the uterus and ovaries,
  respectively); and<br>
  3. <b>Genital reconstruction surgeries</b> (also referred to as &quot;lower&quot;
  or &quot;bottom&quot; surgery or GRS).<br>
  Within these three main groupings are different types of procedures and surgical
  methods that will be further described herein.</p>
<p>This section describes the main types of <b>hysterectomy and oophorectomy</b>
  procedures that are currently available to trans men. <a href="chest.html">Chest
  surgery</a> and <a href="grs.html">genital reconstruction surgeries (GRS)</a>
  are detailed in their own separate sections.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the FTM surgeries listed below are generalized. It is important
  to note that there are different methods for performing a hysterectomy/oophorectomy
  (sometimes referred to as &quot;hysto&quot; and &quot;oopho&quot; in FTM circles);
  the procedure chosen will depend on the physical characteristics of the patient
  as well as the expertise of the surgeon performing the procedure. If you are
  considering any of these procedures, it is important to research your options
  thoroughly and speak candidly with the surgeons you are considering.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="why"></a><b>Why have a hysterectomy/oophorectomy?<br>
  </b>Some physicians recommend hysterectomy and oophorectomy within the first
  5 years of starting testosterone therapy. There are two reasons for this. First,
  there is some concern that long-term testosterone treatment may cause the ovaries
  to develop similar symptoms as those seen in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
  PCOS has been linked to increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia (a condition
  that occurs when the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows too much) and
  thus endometrial cancer, as well as ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it is difficult to prove whether the risk 
  for such cancers is  increased by testosterone therapy in trans men. Trans men are 
  a small population to begin with, and many undergo hysterectomy/oophorectomy 
  early on in their hormonal treatment, thus making the study of long-term effects of testosterone 
  on the uterus and ovaries  difficult. Also, some trans men may have suffered from PCOS before beginning 
  testosterone treatment.</p>
<p>Because the relationship between long-term 
    androgen use and gynecological health is not yet fully understood, and because 
    many trans men experience embarrassment and/or access issues over obtaining 
    ongoing gynecological care, some may feel it is appropriate to pursue such surgeries 
    as a preventative measure. For more information on PCOS, endometrial cancer, 
    and ovarian cancer see the <a href="#resources">resources</a> section at the 
    end of this page.</p>
<p>The second reason why it may be considered beneficial to undergo a hysto/oopho
  is that after the removal of the ovaries, testosterone doses can often be decreased
  because the ovaries are no longer producing estrogen.</p>
<p>If a trans man chooses not to have a hysto/oopho procedure, he should continue to
  have regular Pap smears (to screen for cervical cancer) and should seek out the
  care of a doctor if he experiences any irregular vaginal bleeding (including
  spotting), cramping, or pain. It is not uncommon for trans men who are pre-hysterectomy  to
  experience a buildup of endometrial tissue, especially during the first few
  years of testosterone therapy. Endometrial tissue is normally shed during menstruation,
  but since this process is usually stopped a few months into testosterone therapy,
  additional tissue may continue to build up and may eventually begin to shed
  in the form of spotting. Because irregular bleeding can be a sign of cancer
  (though this is often not the case), trans men who experience any bleeding/spotting
  should see a doctor who will perform tests to determine the cause of the spotting.
  These tests may include an endometrial biopsy and/or an ultrasound. The doctor
  may advise a short course of progesterone to cause the uterus to shed the excess
  endometrial tissue-- this is much like inducing a period. While this may be
  unpleasant, it should be understood as a preventative measure, since the unusual
  buildup of endometrial tissue has been linked to endometrial cancer.</p>

<p><a name="types"></a><b>Types of hysterectomy and Oophorectomy procedures<br>
  </b>There are three main ways in which the uterus can be removed from the body:
  either through an incision in the abdomen, vaginally through an incision
  in the top of the vagina (sometimes assisted laparoscopically through small
  incisions in the abdomen), or through a combination of tissue removal through small incisions in the abdomen as well as through the vagina. The type of surgery chosen will depend on the patient's physical
  limitations as well as the surgeon's expertise.</p>
<p>Some surgeons who perform <a href="grs.html">genital reconstruction surgery 
  (GRS)</a> may wish to do a hysterectomy/oophorectomy at the same time as GRS. 
  If you are considering GRS, you may wish to fully research such options.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH)<br>
    </b>This is the removal of the uterus and the cervix via an incision in the
    abdomen. During the procedure, the surgeon will make an incision, either horizontally
    or vertically, in the abdominal wall. The abdominal muscles will be spread
    apart with retractors. The uterus and cervix are cut away from the surrounding
    ligaments and blood vessels, and then removed by cutting them off at the top
    of the vagina. The vagina is sewn closed at the top.</p>
  <p>The surgical procedure lasts about 1 to 3 hours, and usually involves a hospital
    stay of 3 to 5 days. Recovery is usually a 6 to 8 week period of restricted
    activity. The procedure leaves a 4 to 6 inch scar on the abdomen, usually
    just above the pubic hair line.</p>
  <p><em>Because of the advances in laparoscopic surgical procedures, surgeons will often recommend less invasive procedures such as LAVH or TLH, listed below, if the patient is a good candidate. </em>Laparoscopic procedures generally involve smaller incisions, less scarring, shorter recovery time, and shorter hospital stays than abdominal hysterectomy.</p>
  <p><b>Total Vaginal Hysterectomy (TVH)</b><br>
    This is the removal of the uterus and the cervix via an incision in the vagina; all operating procedures are performed through the vagina.  The uterus and cervix are cut away from the surrounding
    ligaments and blood vessels, and then removed by cutting them off at the top
    of the vagina. The vagina is sewn closed at the top.</p>
  <p>Because there are no incisions made in the abdomen during TVH, the surgeon cannot easily access the abdominal cavity. She/he cannot examine for and remove endometriosis, she/he cannot perform the procedure if adhesions are present, and certain complications may arise if also attempting to remove the ovaries. Additionally, because TVH is performed entirely through the vagina, it is best performed on individuals who have vaginal laxity (i.e. a wide enough and flexible enough vaginal canal, as often seen after childbirth).</p>
  <p>The surgical procedure lasts about 1 to 3 hours, and usually involves a hospital
    stay of 1 to 3 days. Recovery is usually a 6 to 8 week period of restricted
    activity. This surgery is not recommended if your vaginal canal is restricted,
    as the surgeon will need space for instruments and for the removal of the
    organs.<em> For a restricted vaginal canal, your surgeon may recommend TLH as an alternative option.</em></p>
  <p><b>Laparoscopically Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH) </b><br>
    This is similar to TVH above, but performed with the aid of laparoscopy. During the procedure, the surgeon makes several small cuts in the abdominal 
    wall to provide access for a laparoscope (a tiny telescopic camera) and other 
    small surgical instruments. The laparoscope is used by the surgeon to see 
    inside the abdomen during the procedure. The surgeon may perform some of the cutting procedures by working through the abdominal incisions, but other surgical procedures will still be performed through the vagina. The uterus and cervix 
    will be mainly removed through a cut at the top of the vagina, and then the vagina is 
    sewn closed.</p>
  <p>The surgical procedure lasts about 1 to 3 hours, and usually involves a hospital
    stay of 1 to 2 days. Recovery is usually a 4 to 6 week period of restricted
    activity. This surgery is not recommended if your vaginal canal is very restricted,
    as the surgeon will need space for instruments and for the removal of the
    organs. <em>For a restricted vaginal canal, your surgeon may recommend TLH as an alternative option.</em></p>
  <p><strong>Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH)</strong><br>
  Is the removal of the uterus and the cervix by operating through several small cuts in the abdominal 
    wall that provide access for a laparoscope (a tiny telescopic camera) and other 
  small surgical instruments. The uterus is removed by passing the tissue out through the vagina or through one of the small abdominal incisions. Because there is no operating performed through the vagina (though small pieces of tissue can be passed down through it), there is no requirement for a wide vaginal passage, and there are fewer problems with increased urinary incontinence at a later date. </p>
  <p>The surgical procedure lasts about 1 to 3 hours, and usually involves a hospital
    stay of 1 to 2 days. Recovery is usually a 2 to 4 week period of restricted
    activity. Because there is no requirement for a wide vaginal passage and because this procedure involves less blood loss, lowered risk of urinary incontinence, shorter hospital stay, and shorter recovery time for most patients, TLH can be an excellent choice if it is available. Because TLH is a relatively new procedure, not all surgeons are necessarily skilled in its practice. Be sure to inquire as to your surgeon's direct experience with TLH, or with any type of surgical procedure you are considering.</p>
  <p><b>Bilateral Salpingo Oophorectomy (BSO)<br>
    </b> This involves the removal of both ovaries and of both fallopian tubes
    (bilateral=both sides, salpingo=fallopian tubes, oophor=ovaries, ectomy=removal).
    For trans men, this procedure will usually be performed at the same time as your hysterectomy.
    Because the risk of ovarian cancer remains if the fallopian tubes are left
    behind, both the ovaries and fallopian tubes are usually removed during this
    procedure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="risks"></a>Risks &amp; Cost<br>
  </b> As with any surgical procedure, there are some risks that may occur. These
  include bleeding, infection, problems from anesthesia, blood clots, or death
  (rare). Some other problems that have been reported after hysterectomy include
  irritable bowel syndrome, incontinence, damage to the urethra or bowel, prolapse
  of the vagina, back pain, or loss of sexual feeling or function. Depending on the type of procedure you undergo, these risks may be more or less common-- speak directly with your surgeon about the risks of the specific procedures you are considering.</p>
<p>The cost of hysterectomy/oophorectomy will vary, but in general will run between
  $7,000 and $20,000 in the United States (including surgery fees and related
  hospital/staff fees). Because there is usually a hospital stay after the procedure,
  and since hospitals charge by the day, this will effect the overall price depending
  on the duration of the stay.</p>
<p>Hysterectomy is one of the few surgeries that trans men may be able to have covered
  by insurance, if the procedure is shown to be health-related. If you are experiencing
  pain or irregular bleeding, or if you have a history of abnormal Pap smears,
  fibroids, or polyps, you may wish speak with your doctor about the possibility
  of hysterectomy as a necessary procedure for insurance purposes.</p>
