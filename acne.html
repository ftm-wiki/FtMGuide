<p><strong><a name="intro"></a>Introduction<br>
  </strong>Upon starting testosterone therapy, many guys experience problems with 
  acne and related skin conditions. There are two main reasons that breakouts 
  often begin after starting testosterone. First, testosterone causes the the 
  skin's sebaceous glands to produce more sebum (oil), which can cause plugged 
  pores and lead to acne lesions. Second, testosterone also causes increased hair 
  growth on the face, neck, chest, arms, and back, which can lead to irritated 
  follicles and ingrown hairs in those areas, causing puss-filled lesions. In 
  tandem with the increase of hair growth on the face and neck, many trans men begin 
  shaving, and improper shaving technique can lead to rashes and ingrown hairs 
  that can further affect the skin.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that you can do to prevent and treat conditions 
  like acne, ingrown hairs, and shave bumps, but it is important to know which 
  problem you are trying to treat in order to be effective. It may be wise to 
  see a dermatologist (a doctor who is a skin specialist) if the methods listed 
  on this page are not helping-- you may be dealing with a particularly stubborn 
  case of acne, or you may have a combination of multiple skin problems that 
  a dermatologist could better help you to address.</p>
<p><strong><a name="whatisacne" id="whatisacne"></a>What is Acne?<br>
  </strong>Acne is a disorder that effects the pilosebaceous units (PSUs) of the 
  skin. PSUs consist of a &quot;sebaceous&quot; gland (oil-producing gland) connected 
  to a canal called a &quot;follicle.&quot; The follicle contains a fine hair, 
  and the hair grows out through the open end of the canal at the skin's surface. 
  This open end is usually called a &quot;pore.&quot; There are numerous PSUs 
  on the face, upper back, and chest (where acne problems often are worst).</p>
<p>The sebaceous glands produce an oily substance called &quot;sebum&quot; that 
  normally empties onto the skin's surface through the pore. Trouble begins when 
  the follicle becomes plugged, thereby preventing the normal draining of sebum. 
  If a follicle becomes blocked for some reason, the mixture of oil cells within 
  allows the bacteria &quot;Propionibacterium acnes&quot; (P. acnes), which is 
  normally present on the skin, to grow inside the plugged follicle.</p>
<p>The P. acnes bacteria multiplies inside the plugged follicle, causing the body to send white 
  blood cells to that follicle, which in turn causes the area to become inflamed 
  and painful. This leads to a variety of skin lesions.</p>
<p>The basic acne lesion is called the &quot;comedo.&quot; It is simply an enlarged 
  and plugged hair follicle. If the comedo remains beneath the skin, it is called 
  a &quot;closed comedo&quot; and produces a white bump called a &quot;whitehead.&quot; 
  A comedo that reaches the surface of the skin and opens up is called a &quot;blackhead&quot; 
  because it looks black on the skin's surface.</p>
<p>A &quot;papule&quot; is an inflamed lesion that usually appears as a small, 
  pink bump on the skin that may be tender to the touch. A &quot;pustule&quot; 
  is a papule topped by a pus-filled lesion that may be red at the base-- this 
  is commonly called a &quot;pimple.&quot; A &quot;nodule&quot; is a large, painful, 
  solid lesion that is lodged deep within the skin. A &quot;cyst&quot; is a deep, 
  painful, pus-filled lesion that can cause scarring. </p>
<p><strong><a name="whatcausesacne"></a>What Causes Acne?<br>
  </strong>The exact cause of acne is unknown, but a major contributing factor 
  is an increase in testosterone, as testosterone causes the sebaceous glands 
  to produce more oil. Other factors that are believed to contribute to acne include: 
  heredity, frequent irritation caused by rubbing or picking the skin, pressure 
  from tight-fitting hats or clothing, environmental irritants, colognes or other 
  scented products, and scrubbing the skin too hard or too often.</p>
<p> For trans men, the beginning of a testosterone regimen might bring on acne. This 
  might be a temporary condition that clears itself up over a period of months 
  or a couple of years (much like in puberty), or it might remain a persistent 
  problem that requires rigorous treatment.</p>
<p><strong><a name="howisacnetreated"></a>How is Acne Treated?<br>
  </strong>The goals when treating acne are to heal any existing lesions, stop 
  new lesions from forming, and to prevent scarring wherever possible. Treatment 
  is aimed at reducing the problems that play a part in causing acne in the first 
  place: abnormal clumping of cells in the follicles, increased oil production, 
  the presence of bacteria, and inflammation. Depending on the severity of a person's 
  acne, one or more strategies or products may be utilized in a treatment regimen.</p>
<p>There are a variety of tips and techniques that have been reported to help 
  reduce breakouts, as well as numerous over-the-counter (OTC) products to treat 
  mild to moderate acne. Such products and methods are listed below.</p>
<p>For more severe or persistent acne, it may be wise to seek the advice of a 
  dermatologist. A dermatologist may prescribe medications in combination with 
  OTC products, and/or they may diagnose additional skin problems (such as ingrown 
  hairs or other types of skin irritation or infection) that might be contributing 
  to breakouts on the face, back, or shoulders. The most common prescription acne 
  treatments are listed near the end of this page.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><a name="tips" id="tips"></a>Acne Prevention: Tips and Techniques</strong><br>
  While most persistent acne will require at least some form of treatment regimen 
  with cleansers and OTC medications, there are a few basic things that you can 
  do (or not do) that may dramatically reduce breakouts.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Avoid picking and rubbing your skin</strong><br>
    First and foremost, you should avoid picking, scratching, or rubbing the affected 
    skin, and you should especially avoid picking at already existing breakouts. 
    The dirt from your fingers and fingernails can further contribute to clogged 
    pores, and picking can cause additional inflammation and irritation, making 
    symptoms worse.</p>
  <p>You should also avoid squeezing existing pimples. This is especially true 
    if the lesion is a nodule or cyst that is deep within the skin. Squeezing 
    such a lesion will probably only squeeze the bacteria and infection deeper 
    into the skin, thus making the cyst deeper and more irritated, while also 
    making it last longer than it would have normally. It also may increase the 
    chances of scarring. If you have a pimple with a white head where the puss 
    is very near the surface, squeezing it may not be permanently damaging, but 
    the bacteria that are released upon squeezing can spread to other nearby pores, 
    and may also spread deeper within the originally infected pore, causing additional 
    soreness and redness. In general, it is best to treat acne lesions with medicated 
    products, and avoid picking as much as possible.</p>
  <p><strong>Avoid scented or harsh soaps/skin products</strong><br>
    Because acne can be worsened by skin irritants, you may wish to discontinue 
    use of scented products such as colognes, after-shaves, deodorant soaps, or 
    scented oils. Keep in mind that natural products, such as essential oils, can also be irritants to some people. Alcohol-based products, such as certain after-shaves, can also 
    irritate the skin. </p>
  <p><strong>Cleanse the skin gently</strong><br>
    When choosing a soap for washing the face or other affected areas, look for 
    a gentle cleanser that cleans but does not strip your skin of moisture. Do 
    not use deodorant soap or typical shower soap, as these will tend to over-dry 
    and irritate your skin. Do not scrub vigorously with rough scrub pads or abrasives-- 
    this will irritate the skin and might make the problem worse. Try to gently 
    wash once in the morning and once in the evening, and as necessary after vigorous 
    exercise or very dirty tasks.</p>
  <p><strong>Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer</strong><br>
    Many OTC acne medications will tend to dry the skin, as will alcohol-based 
    facial products. While clearing excess oil from the face can be a good thing 
    when trying to prevent acne, if skin becomes to be <em>too</em> dried out 
    it will tend to produce even more oil to compensate, potentially causing additional 
    breakouts. The use of a quality, non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging) moisturizer 
    in combination with gentle cleansing and acne medications can help the skin 
    stay balanced and healthy. Look for moisturizers that are specifically labeled 
    as &quot;non-comedogenic&quot; and fragrance free, so they cause as little 
    irritation and clogging as possible.</p>
  <p><strong>Use proper shaving technique</strong><br>
    Because shaving can irritate the skin, it is best to use proper shaving technique 
    to keep all kinds of facial breakouts, including ingrown hairs, shave bumps, 
    and acne, to a minimum. The <a href="shaving.html">Shaving</a> 
    page provides detailed information about proper shaving technique, as well as notes 
    on shaving and sensitive skin.</p>
  <p><strong>Be consistent with your skin care regimen</strong><br>
    Once you have begun a regimen of gentle cleansing, an OTC or prescription 
    acne treatment, moisturizing, and proper shaving technique, stick with it 
    and be consistent. It can take several weeks for positive effects to show, 
    and once old breakouts are cleared you will still need to be vigilant in order 
    to prevent future breakouts. Washing your face only occasionally or using 
    a product once or twice a week will probably not help with persistent acne.</p>
  <p><strong>Modification of your Testosterone dose, dosing schedule, or T delivery 
    method</strong><br>
    There is much anecdotal evidence of improvement in acne symptoms from trans men 
    who have modified their T dose, their dosing schedule, or the type of T they 
    are using. For example, some trans men note a reduction in acne by switching from 
    a 200mg/2-weeks schedule to a 100mg/week schedule. Others report results from 
    slightly reducing their T dose (for example, from 100mg/week to 90mg/week). 
    Finally, still others report results from switching from T suspended in cottonseed 
    oil to T suspended in sesame oil (or vice-versa), or from injectable T to 
    a daily T cream or gel. Each individual's results may vary.</p>
  <p>You may wish to work with your doctor to try adjusting your dose, schedule, 
    or T delivery method to help reduce acne. You should monitor blood levels 
    and your physical progress while trying such an experiment. For many, a slight 
    reduction in dosage may keep T blood levels squarely within a male range while 
    dramatically reducing acne. Remember that T doses are not &quot;one size fits 
    all,&quot; and that your optimum dose may be 70 or 80mg/week rather than 100mg/week-- 
    the &quot;standard doses&quot; given to most trans men can be finely tuned for 
    each individual. (More on <a href="ttypes.html">testosterone 
    types, dosing, and delivery</a>.)</p>
  <p><strong>Drink more water</strong><br>
    While diet appears to have little effect on acne breakouts, many guys report 
    that increasing their water intake seems to help their skin stay healthy. 
    While this is not a proven medical fact, it can't hurt to give it a try.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><a name="otc"></a>Over-The-Counter (OTC) Acne Treatment</strong><br>
  Benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, resorcinol, and sulfur are the most common 
  OTC medicines used to treat acne. These products are all applied topically to 
  the skin in the affected areas, and are available in many forms, including gel, 
  lotion, cream, soap, or medicated pads. Tea tree oil is a natural product that 
  also has been shown to be effective in treating acne.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Benzoyl Peroxide</strong><br>
    Benzoyl peroxide is an effective antibacterial agent that kills the P. acnes 
    bacteria. It also tends to dry the skin, an effect which is best balanced 
    with the use of a non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging) moisturizer. (<a href="http://www.acne.org">www.acne.org</a> provides advice on a benzoyl 
    peroxide/moisturizing regimen.) Keep in mind that benzoyl peroxide can bleach 
    hair and clothing.</p>
  <p><strong>Salicylic Acid</strong><br>
    Salicylic acid encourages the sloughing of skin cells, thus helping prevent blockage of the follicles. Salicylic 
    acid also helps break down existing blackheads and whiteheads. </p>
  <p><strong>Resorcinol</strong><br>
    Resorcinol helps breakdown hard, rough skin; as such is it good at breaking 
    down existing blackheads and whiteheads. It is usually used in combination 
    with sulfur (see below).</p>
  <p><strong>Sulfur</strong><br>
    Sulfur causes peeling and drying of the skin. It is effective at breaking 
    down existing blackheads and whiteheads.</p>
  <p><strong>Tea Tree Oil</strong><br>
    Tea tree oil is a natural plant product known for its beneficial effects as 
    a deep cleansing, antibacterial, and antifungal agent. Tea tree oil solutions 
    can help clear up acne blemishes and prevent further outbreaks in a manner 
    similar to benzoyl peroxide solution, though it may take longer to produce 
    results. An advantage of tea tree oil is that it does not usually produce 
    the same drying and irritation of the skin that the other products listed 
    above sometimes cause. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be sure to read the active ingredients list on the products you are considering. 
  Because each of these products is potentially irritating to the skin, it is 
  wise to use them only as directed, and to use caution if combining more than 
  one product. For example, if you are regularly using a regimen of benzoyl peroxide 
  to treat your acne, you may not want to add salicylic acid, as the potential irritation may outweigh any added benefit.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it might take up to 8 weeks of regular 
  use for an acne regimen to really begin to show dramatic results. If, after 
  this time, the OTC products you are using have not produced signs of improvement, 
  you might wish to see a dermatologist. They may recommend a different regimen 
  or combine prescription and OTC products in a manner that may show better results.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><a name="prescription"></a>Prescription Acne Treatment: Topical and 
  Oral <br>
  </strong>Patients with moderate to severe acne, or whose acne does not respond 
  to OTC treatments, may be treated by a dermatologist with prescription topical 
  and/or oral medicines. Treatments commonly prescribed by doctors for acne are 
  listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Prescription Topical Medicines<br>
  </strong>Like OTC topical medicines, prescription topical medicines can be prescribed 
  as creams, lotions, solutions, or gels, depending on the patient's needs. 
  With certain prescription products, the skin may look worse before improving, 
  and treatment may take 4 to 8 weeks before producing signs of improvement. Side 
  effects should be carefully discussed with your doctor.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Azelaic acid</strong><br>
    Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid that helps the skin to renew itself 
    more quickly. It prevents the buildup of cells that can plug pores, reduces 
    inflammation, and also helps to kill the P. Acnes bacteria.</p>
  <p><strong>Topical Retinoids<br>
    </strong>Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that have been shown to help 
    treat acne by unplugging clogged pores and preventing dead cells from clogging 
    pores. Topical retinoids are often used along with oral antibiotics or benzoyl 
    peroxide. A potential side-effect is that they can cause drying, redness, and 
    irritation. Examples of topical retinoids are<strong> Tretinoin (Retin-A, 
    Renova, Vitamin A Acid, Retin-A Micro), Adapalene (Differin), </strong>and 
    <strong>Tazarotene (Tazorac). </strong>Tretinoin has also been shown to increase 
    the speed at which surface skin cells are replaced; thus, it is also prescribed 
    to treat sun-damaged skin or wrinkles.</p>
  <p><strong>Topical antibiotics</strong><br>
    Topical antibiotics are substances that are effective against bacteria, including 
    P. acnes. They are often used in combination with other drugs, such as retinoids, 
    where retinoids would be used to clear the pores of excess cells so that the 
    antibiotics have an easier path to the bacteria in an affected follicle.<strong> 
    Erythromycin</strong> is a commonly prescribed topical antibiotic that is 
    effective against P. acnes and has anti-inflammatory qualities. 
    <strong>Clindamycin </strong>is also prescribed to treat acne. </p>
  <p><strong>Sodium Sulfacetamide</strong><br>
    Sodium sulfacetamide is a &quot;sulfonamide&quot; that is used for its antibacterial 
    activity. It curbs the growth of the P. Acnes bacteria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prescription Oral Medicines<br>
  </strong>For moderate or severe acne, a dermatologist might try oral medication 
  (pills), or oral medication in combination with topical treatment. Currently, 
  there are two main forms of oral treatment for acne: <strong>antibiotics</strong> 
  and the retinoid <strong>isotretinoin</strong> (drug name &quot;Accutane&quot;)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Oral antibiotics</strong> help control acne by curbing the growth 
    of bacteria and reducing inflammation. Common oral antibiotics used to treat 
    acne are <strong>erythromycin, tetracycline, minocycline,</strong> and <strong>doxycycline</strong>. 
    There are a number of side effects related to these medications, and these 
    should be discussed with your doctor.</p>
  <p><strong>Isotretinoin- &quot;Accutane</strong>&quot;<br>
    Isotretinoin is a retinoid (a derivative of vitamin A) that is prescribed 
    in pill form, usually for 15-20 weeks. Because of its potential for serious 
    side effects, it is considered a last resort in acne treatment, used when 
    all other approaches have failed. Isotretinoin works by shrinking the oil 
    glands, thus greatly reducing the amount of oil produced.</p>
  <p>Isotretinoin is a very effective medicine that can help prevent scarring. 
    However, there is a risk of serious side effects which should be thoroughly 
    discussed with your doctor before considering Accutane.</p>

<p>There are a number of <a href="#resources">helpful web sites</a> in the resources section that provide specific advice and information 
  about acne products and treatment regimens. </p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><a name="ingrown"></a>Ingrown Hairs, Razor Bumps, and Razor Burn</strong><br>
  It is important to note that blemishes and skin breakouts other than (and in 
  addition to) acne are often brought on by the onset of testosterone therapy. 
  As mentioned in the introduction, increased hair growth on the face and the 
  body can lead to irritated follicles and <strong>ingrown hairs</strong>. Shaving 
  can also lead to ingrown hairs as well as <strong>razor bumps</strong> and <strong>razor 
  burn</strong>. These problems are often mistaken for acne, but must be treated 
  differently.</p>
<p><strong>Ingrown hairs </strong>and <strong>razor bumps</strong> are medically 
  known as &quot;pseudofolliculitis barbae.&quot; <strong>Razor bumps</strong> 
  result from a <em>hair growing out of the skin, curling around and then growing 
  back in</em>. <strong>Ingrown hairs </strong>form when <em>hair fails to grow 
  out of the follicle</em>. Either way, the hair lodged in the skin causes inflammation, 
  followed by pus formation. Psuedofolliculitis barbae appear as tender, red, 
  raised bumps. For this reason, they are sometimes mistaken for acne. If you 
  are unable to tell if you are experiencing acne or pseudofolliculitis barbae, 
  ask your doctor or dermatologist for help in diagnosing your problem. Pseudofolliculitis 
  barbae can be prevented by proper shaving technique-- see the <a href="shaving.html">Shaving</a> 
  page for details, as well as for advice on shaving sensitive skin. Since acne 
  is often worsened by irritation, it pays to shave your face as gently as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Razor burn</strong> is a temporary irritation, redness or swelling 
  of the skin. If you dry shave, shave without adequate cream or gel, or shave 
  too hard or too fast, your skin will likely show some irritation. If you're 
  suffering from razor burn, look for a soothing, non-comedogenic after-shave 
  balm. Avoid alcohol-based aftershaves. You may also want to avoid shaving 
  for a few days in order to let the skin heal itself. Razor burn should go away 
  in a few days, and it is easily prevented through the methods outlined on the 
  <a href="shaving.html">Shaving</a> page.</p>
<p>Again, if you do not see improvement in acne, ingrown hair, shave bumps or 
  other symptoms after these basic methods have been attempted, see a dermatologist 
  in order to properly diagnose and treat your specific condition.</p>
