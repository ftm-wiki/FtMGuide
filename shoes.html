This section lists   a number of online retail sites that feature small men's shoes and size-based   search engines, lift shoes (shoes that add height), as well as pointers for   shoe size conversion between women's and men's shoes, as well as boy's/youth,   UK, and European sizes.</p><p><strong><a name="size"></a>How to find your shoe size<br></strong>The best way to get fitted properly for a pair of shoes is to go to a knowledgeable shoe retailer, in person, who can measure your feet in-store and help you choose the shoe brand that will best suit your measurements and foot type. However, for most guys with feet smaller than the average male population, this is nearly an impossibility-- most stores in the U.S. don't regularly stock men's shoes smaller than size 7. You can still have your feet measured at a quality shoe store to get your size and width measurements, but you'll probably have to take that knowledge elsewhere to buy your shoes. Keep in mind that in the U.S., most shoe stores will probably measure your feet with a metal Brannock device, which will provide you with typical U.S. sizing (but not European or UK sizing). If you are being measured on a Brannock device, be sure to ask for the standard men's measurement.</p><p><a name="measure"></a><strong>Measuring your feet</strong><br>You can measure your feet at home and use your measurement data to purchase shoes from online retailers, who often have a larger range of small men's sizes available than brick-and-mortar stores are able to stock. To measure at home, you'll need a pencil, a two pieces of blank paper, tape, and a flat, smooth floor surface. Measuring your feet at home is much easier with the help of a friend, but you can do it by yourself. It is best to take your measurements late in the day, after being on your feet for a while, so your feet are at their most swollen size.</p><p>Roll up your pant legs or wear shorts to make the measurement easier. Wear the type of socks you  normally wear and keep them taut to your feet-- no sagging or bunching. Place a blank piece of paper on a flat, clean floor surface. Tape it at the corners to keep it from shifting. If you are doing the measurement with a friend, stand normally with your right foot on the paper, and distribute your weight evenly between your two feet. If you are doing the measurement alone, sit in a chair and place your right foot on the paper, with both feet squarely on the floor. Take your pencil and trace all the way around the edge of your foot, keeping the pencil as upright as possible the whole time (perpendicular to the floor). Ensure that the pencil is snug against the foot during the entire tracing. Repeat this process for the left foot. It is important to measure both feet, as one foot is usually larger than the other, and it is best to choose a size based on the larger foot.</p><p>Now you are ready to get your length and width measurements from your tracing. The tracing will be slightly larger than your feet due to the thickness of the pencil. You will need to subtract 0.2 inches (5 mm) from both the length measurement and the width measurement to compensate for the thickness of the  pencil.</p><p> To determine your foot length, measure the distance between the two longest points on your tracing. Subtract 0.2 inches (or 5 mm) from the measurement to compensate for the pencil. The result is your foot length. </p><p>To determine your foot width, measure the distance between the two widest points on your tracing. Subtract 0.2 inches (or 5 mm) from the measurement to compensate for the pencil. The result is your foot width. </p><p>You may wish to convert those numbers to both inches and centimeters, since different shoe companies use different units of measure in relation to their size designation charts.</p><p><a name="convert"></a><strong>Converting measurements to shoe size</strong><br>Now that you have your foot's physical measurements, you can determine how those measurements convert to the various size designations used by different manufacturers. This task can be more difficult than it appears, since shoe manufacturers use different measuring systems (U.S. versus UK or European, etc.). Manufacturers also vary in the way they measure their products to determine size, and sizing may differ depending on the type of shoes they make (men's, women's, youth, athletic, combat boot, etc.). Further, not all systems account for width in a standardized way.</p><p>Thankfully, many online retailers and shoe manufacturers provide size conversion charts based on foot length measurements. Some online stores provide printable Brannock measurement guides that you can use to determine your U.S. shoe size. There are also some good conversion guides listed on the internet, including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe_size#Shoe_size_comparison">shoe size comparison chart</a> on Wikipedia that includes US, UK, European and Mondopoint sizing.</p><p>Whatever chart or system you decide to use to find your shoe size, keep in mind that the standards and methods for measuring size really do vary quite a bit. Thus you might find you have a pair of boots in size 6 that fit well, and a pair of running shoes in size 7 that also fit well-- your shoe size will be a general guideline, and each brand may fit differently.</p><p>It is also important to note that overall foot length is not always a perfect way to determine your best size. For example, if your toes are very long or very short in comparison to the overall proportions of your foot, you might need to go up a size to find a good fit. Remember that tight-fitting shoes can cause a number of foot problems, which can eventually lead to other issues in your legs and back. So don't get shoes that are too snug-- if they don't feel right when you try them on, they will probably never feel right!</p><p>Look for shoe stores where you can try on the shoes before buying. If you are using an online source, choose one that offers a fair returns policy so that you can return or exchange shoes that do not fit correctly. And be kind to your online shoe retailer-- try on your new shoes indoors, on clean floors, and wearing clean socks, so if you choose to return them they remain in new, salable condition.</p><p>The following are some general size conversion tips that can be used as quick rules of thumb if you already know your U.S. shoe size.</p><p><a name="womens"></a><strong>Women's sizes</strong><br>  If you already know your U.S. size in women's shoes, the conversion to men's   is fairly simple-- just subtract 1.5. So, if you wear a U.S. size 7 in women's shoes,   then you should wear around U.S. size 5.5 in men's shoes. (Please note that this is an approximation, and that each style of shoe may fit differently.)</p><p><strong><a name="youth"></a>Youth sizes<br>  </strong>If you have very small feet (men's size 5 or below), you may also wish   to try boy's or youth size shoes. In fact, this can be a distinct advantage   when buying a quality name brand shoe, as youth sizes are sometimes less expensive   than adult sizes (for example, Timberland makes a classic waterproof work boot that   costs $160 in adult size but only $80 in a junior size, yet they look identical,   and the quality of the junior boot is excellent). Do be sure to check the quality   of the particular youth shoes you are considering, however, as some youth shoes are not   made to the same standards as adult shoes.</p><p><strong><a name="uk" id="uk"></a>UK and European sizing</strong><br>  Opinions on the conversion from U.S. sizes to UK and European sizes vary. For the most part, UK sizes tend to run a half size to one full   size smaller than U.S. sizes in men's shoes (i.e., if you wear a U.S. men's   5, you would wear a UK 4 or 4.5).</p><p>When converting from U.S. sizes to European sizes, it is best to follow the   recommendations of the store that you are purchasing from, or have them measure   your foot for European sizing. If you are ordering online, you may wish to simply   to provide your actual foot measurements in inches or centimeters; some online   sellers provide sizing charts based on physical measurements. When in doubt,   contact customer service and check on the company's return policy. A number   of the online sellers listed below offer free return shipping if shoes do not   fit properly.</p><p><strong><a name="width"></a>Width</strong><br>  Different vendors use different terms for shoe widths. Check with the store   you are buying from to see how they designate width. In general, narrow widths   are designated by the letters A, B, and sometimes C for men's shoes (Please   note: the letter C may be considered wide for a women's shoe designation, but   narrow for a men's). Very narrow widths are designated by AA or AAA. Wider shoes   are designated by the letters E through EEEEEE (sometimes noted as 2E, 3E, 6E,   etc.). Occasionally, shoes may be marked with a &quot;W&quot; for wide, &quot;N&quot;   narrow, or &quot;S&quot; for slim. Each manufacturer's shoe will fit a little   differently. If a shoe does not feature a special width notation, you can assume   it is a standard or &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;M&quot; width. Remember, some   companies standard widths run wider than others.</p><p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p><hr><p><strong><a name="smallsizes"></a>Online Shoe Retailers with Small Sizes</strong></p><p><strong>Zappos</strong><br>  <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-2883300-6672897" target="_top" onMouseOver="window.status='http://www.zappos.com/bin/zapposset?src=cj&ref=comjun';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=' ';return true;">zappos.com</a><img src="http://www.awltovhc.com/image-2883300-6672897" width="1" height="1" border="0"/><br>Zappos has one of the best search engines for finding small and specialty sizes.   Their men's size search engine goes all the way down to size 3, and widths can   be searched from 3A to 6E.

The advantages   to lifts are that they are generally less expensive than shoes with built-in   lifts, and you can use them in any pair of shoes that you already own (so that   you can be taller in all of your shoes rather than just one pair). Lifts can be bought in incremental sets to gradually increase your height over time so   that your sudden &quot;growth&quot; is less noticeable.</p><p>The disadvantages of lifts are that they need to be replaced every few months   (due to hygienic reasons), they may be uncomfortable, and the larger-sized lifts   may not fit in smaller shoes. It may be best to try a modest-sized pair of lifts   first (perhaps 1 inch or 1.25 inches) to see if they are comfortable, and then   think about working up to larger lifts.</p><p><strong>Lift shoes</strong> differ from removable shoe lifts in that extra height   is built into the shoe's design itself, thereby (usually) allowing for a better   fit and feel than lifts. However, many still find lift shoes to be uncomfortable;   as with any shoe, some styles and brands may be more comfortable and fit better   than others.</p><hr><p><strong>Shoe Lifts</strong></p><p><strong>Levitator Lifts</strong><br>  <a href="http://www.talleryou.com/">www.talleryou.com</a><br>  This company makes affordable shoe lifts in 8 sizes, ranging from 1/2 inch lifts   ($9.95/pair) to 2-1/2 inch lifts ($24.95/pair). They are made of a lightweight foam   that remains firm under pressure. These lifts may be better for men with smaller-sized   feet because they are not full insoles; they simply slip into the heel area   of the shoe.</p><p><strong>Taller Heels</strong><br>    <a href="http://www.tallerheels.com">www.tallerheels.com</a><br>  This site offers a number of different types of shoe lifts, inserts, and other shoe accessories.<br></p><p><strong>Lift Shoes</strong></p><p><strong>Richlee Shoe Company</strong><br>  <a href="http://www.elevatorshoes.com/">www.elevatorshoes.com</a><br>  Features lift shoes in dress, sport, work, and casual styles that make   you appear 2 to 3 inches taller, depending on the shoe model.
