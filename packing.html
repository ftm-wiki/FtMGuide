<p><a name="intro"></a><strong>Introduction<br>
</strong>The term &quot;packing&quot; refers to the process of creating a male-looking and/or male-feeling
  bulge in one's crotch. This can be accomplished through a home-made or store-bought
  pants stuffer, or through a realistic-looking prosthetic device. A packing device
  may be referred to as a &quot;packer&quot; or &quot;packy,&quot; or as an &quot;STP
  packer&quot; if it can also be used to pee through while standing up (STP= Stand
  To Pee). Some guys simply refer to their packer or prosthetic as a cock and
balls, a dick, etc.</p>
<p>The goal of packing differs depending on who is doing it. A number of trans men
  do not pack at all-- some find it too hot and/or sticky, others find it
  uncomfortable and/or inconvenient, and still others find it personally unnecessary. Some trans men pack simply for the sake of creating a realistic-looking bulge in
  their pants. Others may pack only on certain occasions (while swimming, while
  in the locker room, or wearing tight-fitting pants). Still others may feel incomplete
  and/or conspicuous without wearing a packer or prosthetic device. Some have
  realistic prosthetics that are affixed to the skin for wear throughout the day
  and night. For many trans men, the term &quot;packing&quot; itself is not even an accurate
  descriptor for the wearing of a prosthetic device-- a prosthetic may be considered
  an extension of the body rather than merely a pants-stuffer.</p>
<p>For
    the sake of convenience for the reader, many types of packers as well as prosthetics
    are included in this section, with the understanding that different individuals
    may have different uses for and feelings about such devices.</p>
<p>This section covers a range of packers, including home-made devices, pre-made
  items that can be purchased in stores or over the internet, and professionally-made
  prosthetic penises, as well as straps and harness devices that can be used to
  hold a packer in place.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p>
<p><strong><a name="packinghard"></a>Packing hard</strong><br>
  To &quot;pack hard&quot; refers to the wearing of a dildo or other prosthetic
  device that is erect and can be used for sexual penetration. As the vast majority
  men do not walk around for most of the day with an erect penis, this section
  is devoted mainly to &quot;soft packing,&quot; or packing with the intent to
  create the look and/or feel of a flaccid penis and scrotum.</p>
<p>There are times when packing hard might be attempted (for example, just before 
  sexual activity is anticipated). However, for general day-to-day packing, it 
  is not recommended that you pack hard, as the look it creates will be unrealistic. 
  Devices that can be used specifically for sexual penetration are described in 
  the <a href="packinghard.html">Packing Hard</a> section.</p>
<p>There are very few products that have been designed for &quot;dual use&quot; (i.e.,
  they can be packed fairly comfortably in everyday situations and can also be
  used for penetrative sex). Such &quot;dual use&quot;/&quot;pack and play&quot;  packers and prosthetics
  are also included below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="maleanatomy"></a>A note about male anatomy</strong><br>
  For those who are packing for the first time, and who may not have a lot of 
  direct experience with men's penises, it can be helpful to do a little research 
  in order to create a realistic look. In order to see what male anatomy tends 
  to look like in underwear, in swim trunks, or jeans or slacks, it can be helpful 
  to look at men's clothing catalogs or internet retailers of menswear or men's 
  underwear-- this way, you can stare as much as you want at guys' crotches without 
  having to worry about offending or upsetting anyone. In order to get an idea 
  for how the male anatomy looks and sits on the body, you might wish to look 
  at a magazine, web site, or book that shows flaccid penises. The web site <a href="http://www.erectionphotos.com">www.erectionphotos.com</a> 
  has a &quot;soft/hard&quot; section, showing penises in both flaccid and erect 
  states. It shows variation in the size and shape of men's penises, and shows 
  men of varying body types and ages. The site is not pornographic, is free of charge, 
  and provides useful information on erection curves, penis shape and size, and 
  scientific studies on those topics. Searching the web for &quot;flaccid penis 
  photos&quot; will yield other results as well. Just keep in mind while you are 
  looking that the average length for a flaccid penis tends to be just over 
  3 inches, and that the men you see in most porn sites and movies will tend to 
  be very well-endowed, and will usually be shown while erect. </p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><a name="homemade"></a>Packing devices: home-made</strong><br>
  There are affordable and realistic looking/feeling packers on the market today,
  but if you are very short on cash, are just starting to pack, or simply do not
  want to invest in a store-bought packer, the following home-made devices can
  serve quite adequately, and can be adjusted to your own tastes.</p>
<p><strong><a name="socks"></a>Socks</strong><br>
  The use of a rolled up sock is an inexpensive way to create a bulge. Be
  realistic-- don't use your thickest athletic socks rolled up in a big ball!
  You may wish to use a jock strap to keep the sock(s) in place, or you may try
  pinning the sock(s) to the inside of your underwear so that they don't shift
  or fall out. You also may want to try tying the sock with a string or strings
  to help hold its shape, so that it doesn't unfold or unroll in your pants as
  you move.</p>
<p>A big disadvantage of using socks is that the extra layer of material in your
  pants can be uncomfortably warm and cause sweating and lingering dampness. Socks also do not feel realistic-- if you are
  concerned that someone might come in close contact with your crotch, you may
  wish to use a different method.</p>
<p><strong><a name="gak"></a>Condoms and hair gel or &quot;gak&quot;</strong><br>
  This method feels more realistic than the sock method, and is fairly inexpensive. Keep in mind, though, that the least expensive, pre-molded store-bought packer costs about $10-15, will not require any assembly, and will last much longer than the method listed here, so cost savings won't be that great overall.
  To make this packer, you will need a few unlubricated condoms and some unscented
  hair gel or &quot;gak.&quot; Gak can be made at home with white glue, water,
  and borax (the recipe is listed below).</p>
<p>Partially fill a condom with hair gel or gak-- this will be your dick. Leave
  enough room so that you can tie the condom, and so that the size of the dick
  is realistic. Tie the condom tightly, place it inside another condom, and tie
  that one tightly. If you are expecting to be very active, you might want to
  &quot;triple bag&quot; and add another condom.</p>
<p>If you wish to make balls, you can make two smaller pieces in the same manner,
  and tie them inside a third condom to mimic a scrotum. You can then carefully
  tie the whole package together.</p>
<p>This packer can be worn in a jock strap, or in tight fitting underwear. It
  can also be worn in a number of the store-bought harness/strap items <a href="#harnesses">listed
  below</a>. You may wish to place the packer in the toe of a nylon stocking or
  in a thin sock (a baby sock works well), as unlubricated condoms can pull on
    your public hair in a way that is uncomfortable.</p>
<p>For this type of packer, gak tends to be more realistic in feel than hair gel.
  The main disadvantage of this packer is that it can be accidentally torn or
  punctured. It should be replaced every few months, or whenever it shows signs
  of wear. Again, since store-bought packers can be purchased for $10-15, it is probably more cost-effective to just purchase one rather than make one of these every few months.</p>
<p><strong>Recipe for gak</strong><br>
  Items needed:<br>
  2 containers<br>
  1 measuring cup (ml)<br>
  hot water<br>
  1 stirring stick <br>
  1 large container non-toxic, all-purpose white glue (such as &quot;Elmer's&quot; 
  or school glue)<br>
  1 box borax<br>
  tap water <br>
  Directions:<br>
  Label the containers: one &quot;A&quot; and the other &quot;B.&quot;<br>
  Measure out 30 ml of tap water and pour into container &quot;A.&quot;<br>
  Measure out 30 ml of Elmer's glue and pour into cup &quot;A&quot;.<br>
  Stir thoroughly, about 1 minute. Set aside.<br>
  Measure out 240 ml of hot water and pour into container &quot;B.&quot;<br>
  Measure out 16 ml of borax and pour into cup &quot;B.&quot;<br>
  Stir thoroughly until totally dissolved. Set aside for 2 minutes.<br>
  Measure out 30 ml of the dissolved solution in container &quot;B.&quot;<br>
  Pour this measurement into container &quot;A.&quot;<br>
  <strong>Immediately</strong> start stirring. Stir until it thickens into a gel-like 
  state. <br>
  With the remaining contents of container &quot;B,&quot; you can measure out 
  additional contents of &quot;A&quot; mixture to make additional gak, or throw 
  out remaining contents of &quot;B.&quot; </p>

<p><strong><a name="storebought"></a>Packing devices: store-bought</strong><br>
  Realistic and affordable packers, as well as STP devices, have been
  developed in recent years. There are a number of online retail outlets from
  which these products can be purchased, including sites operated by trans men. The main types of packers are listed below, along with general pricing
  information and retail contacts. Keep in mind that pricing and availability
  may change.</p>
<p><strong>Caring for yourself and your packer:<br>
  A note about silicone, cyberskin, ultraskin, softskin, elastomer, and other materials</strong><br>
  Store-bought packers are made out of different types of materials. When purchasing
  a packer, it is important to know what the device is made of and how to care
  for it and use it safely.</p>
<p>The surface of packers made from materials such as &quot;cyberskin,&quot; &quot;ultraskin,&quot;
  &quot;softskin,&quot; &quot;elastomer,&quot; &quot;siligel,&quot; or &quot;thermal gel&quot; is porous, meaning it can easily
  pick up dirt and bacteria. If you try to use these devices for any kind of sex play,
  they should always be used with condoms. Keeping these types of materials clean
  will help maintain their texture and quality. They should be washed frequently
  with mild soap and warm water, and rinsed well. They <strong>cannot</strong>
  be boiled for sterilization purposes, as this would melt the material. When
  storing or wearing them, you may wish to dust their surface lightly with cornstarch to
  keep them from collecting dirt and lint, and also to keep them from sticking to your skin. (Do not use talcum powder for this purpose,
  as there is some evidence that the use of talcum powder has been linked to cervical
  cancer.) Generally, porous packer materials will show wear over time, including discoloration, pilling, and even a little shrinkage. As such, they need to be replaced periodically, depending on your wear habits.</p>
<p>Packers can also be made from soft, high quality silicone. 100% silicone products are non-porous and can be sterilized 
  by boiling in water for 1-2 minutes. Silicone packers should also be regularly washed with a mild 
  soap and hot water, then rinsed and dried thoroughly. When
  storing or wearing them, you may wish to dust their surface lightly with cornstarch to
  keep them from collecting dirt and lint, and also to keep them from sticking to your skin. (Do not use talcum powder for this purpose,
  as there is some evidence that the use of talcum powder has been linked to cervical
  cancer.) Care should 
  be taken to avoid breaking the surface of silicone. Once a crack has formed, 
  silicone can tear quite easily. Other than potential tearing, silicone packers tend to show less wear and tear than porous-material packers. When cared for properly, silicone lasts longer than many porous materials.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most porous-material soft packers are less expensive than their soft-silicone counterparts.</p>

<p><strong><a name="softpackintro"></a>Soft packers: introduction</strong><br>
  Affordable, realistic-feeling soft packers are available through a variety
  of sources on the internet, as well as in some sex shops. For the most part,
  the soft packers listed below fall into the two basic categories summarized above: <strong>A. Porours material packers</strong> (like &quot;softskin&quot;/&quot;thermal
  gel&quot;/&quot;elastomer&quot;/etc.), or <strong>B. Soft-silicone packers</strong>. </p>
<p>Within <strong>category A</strong>, there are four widely available kinds of &quot;softskin&quot;/&quot;thermal
  gel&quot;/&quot;elastomer&quot; packers:<br>
  1. &quot;Mr. Limpy&quot; or &quot;Mr. Softie&quot; (different stores will call it by different names, but they are all the
  same packer), made by Fleshlight<br>
  2. The &quot;Sailor&quot; (formerly called the &quot;GV Soft Pack&quot;), made by Pleasure Works<br>
  3. &quot;Pack It Light&quot; and &quot;Pack It Heavy,&quot; made by Doc Johnson<br>
  4. &quot;Packer Gear,&quot; made by California Exotics
  <br>
  <br>
There are a few additional soft packers in this category, such as the &quot;Masho&quot; packer, that are similar to the packers listed above, but a little more difficult to find.</p>
<p>Within <strong>category  B</strong>, there are three widely available kinds of soft-silicone packers:<br>
  1. 
&quot;Mr. Right&quot;, made by Vixen with their special &quot;VixSkin&quot; silicone formulation.<br>
2. &quot;Pierre,&quot; an uncircumcised packer made by New York Toy Collective (also available in a small size appropriate for trans youth)<br>
3. &quot;Archer,&quot; also made by New York Toy Collective (also available in a small size appropriate for trans youth)</p>
<p>In addition to those listed above, there is a growing variety of silicone soft packers available from individuals and do-it-yourselfers who make silicone products in their homes. These are often trans men or allies who have started producing packers of various designs. The quality and the availability of such products varies quite a bit, as individual commitment to production can vary.</p>
<p>Finally,  there are  more expensive, highly-detailed, professionally-made packing products also made from silicone-- these are listed farther down this page in the <a href="#prosthetics">Prosthetics</a> section.</p>
<p>The widely-available and most popular soft pack choices are described in detail below.</p>
<p><strong><a name="softpack" id="softpack"></a>A. Softskin/thermal gel/elastomer packers </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mister Softie Elastomer Packer</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/fleshlight-mr-softie-soft-packer.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
  The Mister Softie Elastomer packer, made by Fleshlight, is a realistic-looking packer made from phthalate-free elastomer, a soft, flexible
  material that maintains the same temperature as your body and feels realistic
  when squeezed. It is made into the shape of a flaccid penis and scrotum, and
  is available through the Tool Shed in two flesh-tone colors: vanilla and caramel. The Mr. Softie comes in
  three shaft sizes, 3.5 inches for $13.00, 5.5 inches for $14.00, and 6.5 inches for $15.00. The 3.5 inch
model has larger testicles than the 5.5 or 6.5 inch models. <strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org. The Tool Shed is a trans and partner friendly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sailor aka GV Soft Pack</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/pleasure-works-sailor-soft-packer.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Sailor (formerly known as the GV Soft Pack), made by Pleasure Works, is made a bit differently than the &quot;Mr. Softie&quot; listed above. The shaft of the packer features a slightly stiffer inner core material that provides a bit more of a realistic feel, and the outer design of the shaft includes veins and texture on the scrotum. It is made of a phthalate-free softskin. The Sailor is available  in two shaft sizes, a 4 inch model (&quot;Sailor 1&quot;) for $24.00 and a 5 inch model (&quot;Sailor 2&quot;) for $28.00. Colors are vanilla, caramel, and chocolate.<br>
<strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org. The Tool Shed is a trans and partner friendly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pack It Light/Pack It Heavy</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/doc-johnson-pack-it-lite-soft-packer.html"soft+packer+by+Doc+Johnson"&search_in_description=1">www.toolshedtoys.com</a> | <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/doc-johnson-pack-it-heavy-soft-packer.html"soft+packer+by+Doc+Johnson"&search_in_description=1">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Pack It soft packers, made by Doc Johnson, are made of a material just like  the Sailor, but without the firmer inner core in the shaft. They have veins and detailing on the shaft, but slightly smaller testicles. Pack It is available  in two shaft lengths: the &quot;Pack It Light&quot;, which is a 4.5 inch model for $19.00, and the &quot;Pack It Heavy,&quot; a 5.5 inch model for $21.00. Colors are vanilla, caramel, and chocolate.<br>

<p><strong>Packer Gear Packer from</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/california-exotics-packer-gear-soft-packer.html"packer+gear"&search_in_description=1"soft+packer+by+Doc+Johnson"&search_in_description=1">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Packer Gear soft packers, made by California Exotics, are similar in the &quot;feel&quot; of their material to the Mr. Softie/Limpy packer made by Fleshlight, but they have more detailing. The Packer Gear has shaft veins, scrotal skin wrinkles, and reasonably-sized balls. Packer Gear is available  in two shaft lengths: the 4 inch model for $13.00, and the 5 inch model for $15.00. Colors are vanilla and caramel.<br>

<hr>
<p><strong><a name="siliconesoftpack"></a>B. Soft-silicone packers</strong><br>
Soft silicone packers have a few substantial differences from their softskin/elastomer counterparts. First, even when  cast in a soft formulation, 100% silicone packers tend to be a bit firmer and less flexible/stretchy than softskin/elastomer. They also tend to be a bit denser and heavier. This is simply due to the inherent differences in the materials.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, 100% silicone packers are non-porous and can be sterilized, and they are easier to keep clean over the long term than softskin/elastomer packers. The surface of the silicone will not &quot;pill&quot; or deteriorate (though if nicked or cut, silicone can tear). Silicone also may be a good choice for people who have sensitive skin or find themselves to be irritated by softskin/elastomer packers.</p>
<p><strong>Pierre Uncircumcised</strong>&lrm;<strong> Packer</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/new-york-toy-collective-pierre-soft-packer.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
  For many years, the only way to get  an uncut packer was to work with a professional prosthetics-maker, but  Pierre (made by New York Toy Collective)  offers a more affordable price for those who want a natural look.  The silicone on the Pierre is very soft-- probably the softest of all the silicone packers on the market at the moment. It comes in one
  size only: width at maxium point 2", total length 5.25", weight 6.9 oz.  Available in 4 skin tones: cashew, caramel, hazelnut, and chocolate.<br>
$54.00<br>
<strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org. The Tool Shed is a trans and partner friendly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Archer Packer</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/new-york-toy-collective-archer-soft-packer.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Archer soft packer by New York Toy Collective is designed to be  compact and realistic. This design features over 85 skinfolds  and asymmetrical realism.   The silicone on the Archer, like on the Pierre (above), is very soft-- probably the softest of all the silicone packers on the market at the moment. It comes in one
  size only: width at maxium point 2", total length 5.25", weight 6.9 oz.  Available in 4 skin tones: cashew, caramel, hazelnut, and chocolate.<br>
$54.00<br>
<strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org. The Tool Shed is a trans and partner friendly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Right</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/vixen-mister-right-packer.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
This packer is made from a soft, molded silicone that feels realistic.
  The shaping includes slightly different-sized textured balls and a detailed head. It is firmer and a bit heavier than the type-A soft packers
  listed above, and it holds it shape more firmly. Because this packer is made
  of silicone, it is easy to keep clean and can be sterilized, and it can be less irritating for those with any kind of skin sensitivity. It comes in one
  size only, a 4-1/2 inch shaft length with a 1-1/4 inch diameter shaft. Three colors are available:
  vanilla, caramel, and chocolate.<br>
$49.00<br>
<strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org. The Tool Shed is a trans and partner friendly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SMALL Pierre Uncircumcised</strong>&lrm;<strong> Packer</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/new-york-toy-collective-pierre-small-soft-packer.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
For parents looking for an appropriately-sized soft packer for their trans child, there are now two choices made by New York Toy Collective. The SMALL Pierre is made from the same design as the Pierre (above), but scaled down to be much smaller. The total length of entire packer is just under 4 inches, or about the length of 3 quarters lined up in a row. The shaft length is about 3 inches. Width of balls at widest point is 1.75&quot;. Available in 4 skin tones: cashew, caramel, hazelnut, and chocolate.<br>
$45.00<br>

<p><strong><a name="dualuse"></a>Dual-use packers </strong><br>
  There are very few packing products that have been designed for &quot;dual-use&quot; (i.e., 
  they can be packed fairly comfortably in everyday situations and can also be 
  used for penetrative sex). See also 
  the higher-end dual-use devices in the &quot;<a href="#prosthetics">prosthetics</a>&quot; 
  section.</p>
<p>If you are anticipating sexual activity, having a dual-use packer available
  can be quite helpful. However, if you plan any vigorous motion, you'll probably
  have to wear such packers with a harness. You also may want to use plenty of lubricant, as they tend to be a bit less firm than most dildos/prosthetics designed for penetration.</p>
<p>For general day-to-day packing, wearing dual-use packers is usually not very comfortable,
  and may also look and feel unrealistic, as though you are sporting an erection or semi-erection all day. Use you judgment when considering
  these packers-- they might not be the best for everyday wear.</p>
<p><strong>Shilo</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/new-york-toy-collective-shilo.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a>  <br>
The New York Toy Collective's Shilo is made with a bendable inner rod running the length of the shaft, allowing the wearer to bend it up, down, or to the side while in everyday packing situations. Shilo is made from a soft, skin-like silicone, and it has a very pronounced head with a veined shaft. Optional testicles (the <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/new-york-toy-collective-love-bump-balls-attachment.html">Love Bump</a>) can be purchased with the Shilo in matching skin tones from the same soft silicone. The inner rod is quite durable, and there is little danger of it poking through the shaft due to how the Shilo is made. Diameter: 1.3125&quot; (head with is 1.75&quot; at widest point), length is 6.5&quot; (6&quot; insertable length), Available in 4 skin tones: cashew, caramel, hazelnut, and chocolate. $145 ($35 for Love Bump)</p>
<p><strong>Hugo and Tomas</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/t-mens-junk-shop-hugo-3-in-1-pack-and-play.html"> www.toolshedtoys.com</a> | <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/t-mens-junk-shop-tomas-3-in-1-pack-and-play.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Hugo and Tomas are both STP-compatible, 3-in-1 realistic silicone prosthetics. The difference between the Hugo and the Tomas is that the Tomas is hand-painted with 9 layers of extrinsic silicone color &amp; skin tones to give finely  sculptured skin details. Hugo is produced in a solid skin tone, but still has the sculpted details of veins and skin folds. Both Hugo and Tomas are fitted with a removable flexible, jointed hard plastic insert  for use during sexual play. During everyday packing, that insert is  removed to create the feel of a flaccid penis. The shaft is hollowed to  allow for use as a Stand-To-Pee packer. You can use the flexible blue  silicone STP funnel included with the Hugo or Tomas, or you can add your own  removable funnel device that might work better with your body. The hollowed area  behind the balls will work with most STP funnel devices. </p>

  If you are looking for a highly realistic packer that is handmade or custom made to your specifications, you might want to explore the prosthetics companies listed below. Some prosthetics can even be attached to the skin using a special adhesive, for extra realism. See the specific recommendations from the manufacturer as to whether the prosthetic you are considering can be glued on.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo and Tomas</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/t-mens-junk-shop-hugo-3-in-1-pack-and-play.html"> www.toolshedtoys.com</a> | <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/t-mens-junk-shop-tomas-3-in-1-pack-and-play.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
  The Hugo and Tomas are both STP-compatible, 3-in-1 realistic silicone prosthetics. The difference between the Hugo and the Tomas is that the Tomas is hand-painted with 9 layers of extrinsic silicone color &amp; skin tones to give finely  sculptured skin details. Hugo is produced in a solid skin tone, but still has the sculpted details of veins and skin folds. Both Hugo and Tomas are fitted with a removable flexible, jointed hard plastic insert  for use during sexual play. During everyday packing, that insert is  removed to create the feel of a flaccid penis. The shaft is hollowed to  allow for use as a Stand-To-Pee packer. You can use the flexible blue  silicone STP funnel included with the Hugo or Tomas, or you can add your own  removable funnel device that might work better with your body.

<p><strong>FreeToM Prosthetics</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.freetomprosthetics.com">www.freetomprosthetics.com</a><br>
FreeToM Prosthetics is a transgendered medical prosthesis manufacturing company located in  Portland, Oregon. Using high quality materials and techniques, each prosthetic is carefully handmade and is unique-- they are molded from volunteer cis males for extra realism. All their prosthetics are made from 100% silicone, are easy to clean and are offered in multiple skin tones. They offer a number of models, from a very realistic looking &quot;Buddy&quot; packer ($89), to an STP pack-and-pee ($219), to multi-use models for packing, peeing, and sexual play (4 sizes available range from $198 to $220). Generally, these prosthetics are <strong>not</strong> designed to be glued in place.</p>
<p><strong>Pee-Cock 3-in-1 Packer</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.peecockproducts.com">www.peecockproducts.com</a><br>
This product, introduced in 2011, is designed to be a stand-to-pee packer and pack-and-play model all in one. Made of soft silicone, the shaft of the Pee-Cock has an opening throughout its length to allow for urination. The opening through the shaft also can accommodate a flexible &quot;erection rod&quot; that is inserted through the back of the packer to allow the Pee-Cock to be used for sexual penetration. The back of the packer is shaped like the opening of a funnel; it is pressed low and tightly against the body over the urethral opening during urination. Due to the shape of the funnel, the Pee-Cock may also work well for men who have had metoidioplasty.</p>
<p>The Pee-Cock comes in three sizes, 4 inches ($129), 5.5 inches ($139), and 6.5 inches ($149). They are in the flaccid state when worn without the erection rod. There are 3 shades of skin tones available: caucasian, moderate brown or dark brown. Pee-Cock Products also offers two harnesses to wear with the Pee-Cock.</p>
<p><strong>Like Real Prosthetics</strong><br>
  <a href="http://like-real-us.com">like-real-us.com</a><br>
The professionally-made prosthetics offered on the Like Real site include both flaccid and erect models that are designed to be attached to the body with medical adhesive. A number of the flaccid models are equipped with an STP urination system that is built into the packer (the erect models do not have a urination system). There are flaccid models featuring the appearance of uncut foreskin, as well as circumcized models, and they offer a choice of 5 skin tone options. The detailing is quite realistic, and you can view videos of most products to see multiple views. Like Real also offers the medical adhesive and adhesive remover needed to wear the packers affixed to the skin. Prices range from around $200 to just over $700, and they do sell sets that include both flaccid and erect prosthesis.</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.tyron2.net/">www.tyron2.net</a><br>
  The creator of the Project, based in Germany, began 
  working with silicones and plastics in order to create a realistic, durable, and comfortable prosthetic for trans men. As a trans man himself, he became 
  aware of some of the limitations of other prosthetic products, and has attempted 
  to address those in the Project's development.</p>
<p>The site offers a product called &quot;Phase 4&quot;--a 
very realistic-looking dick and testicles that can be worn both flaccid and erect. It is designed to be attached with <a href="#adhesive">medical adhesive</a> at both the  pelvis and at a very small area just below the tailbone. The prosthetic can become erect if you desire by pumping the balls until the shaft reaches full length and desired hardness. A release valve returns the prosthetic to its flaccid state. The shaft is designed to lay naturally when flaccid. </p>
<p>The flaccid size is about 4 inches long, and the erect size is about 6.5 inches long. The skin on the shaft and scrotum are soft and flexible move freely when touched. 9 different skin tones are available. Bluish veins can be seen and felt when erect, but not when flaccid. The prosthetic is made of silicone, and can be boiled to disinfect. </p>
<p>Phase 4 comes with a care guide (available in English or German), and the cost is 1,209 Euro. The site does not sell adhesives, but provides recommendations for where to purchase them. Prices can be converted to U.S. Dollars at the following web site: <a href="http://www.xe.com/ucc/">www.xe.com/ucc</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Camouflage Prosthetics</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.ftmprosthetics.com">www.ftmprosthetics.com</a><br>
This is the web site of a professional prosthetics maker in Australia who makes realistic penile prosthetics specifically for the FTM community. He makes flaccid, erect, and dual-use prosthetics, and each is custom made in a size that suits you, and from a choice of 15 skin shades.</p>
<p>These prosthetics are designed to be attached to the pubic area with <a href="#adhesive">medical adhesive</a>. But they can also be worn in the packing harnesses <a href="#harnesses">listed below</a>.</p>
<p> The flaccid models include small, mid, and large (approximately 3 inches, 4 inches, and 5 inches, respectively), and examples can be seen on the web site. They can be made with or without foreskin. They are made from silicone on the exterior and filled with a special gel so that the prosthesis is soft to the touch and will squash slightly when squeezed. All sizes are AU$730.00.</p>
<p>The dual-use prosthesis is hard enough for penetration, but soft enough for daily wear. It hangs down so that is does not create too much of a bulge. This model can be purchased with or without testicles. The model with testicles has a flexible implant in the core, so that you can bend it upward for penetration. The regular-size dual model is 5 inches in length, and the large size is 6 inches in length. The regular dual model without testicles is AU$1260; with testicles is AU$1400. The large dual model comes with testicles and is AU$1500.</p>

Base prices start at $329.99 and go up to $579.99, with additional fees for custom options. Please note: because these prosthesis are relatively long, they may not be suitable for smaller or average size men for everyday, flaccid packing purposes.</p>

STP-FITZ, an FTM-owned business, retrofits soft packers into an STP packer with a silicone funnel receptacle.</p>
<p>The STP FITZ 2.0 receptacle is a design improvement over previous &quot;nipple&quot; style STPs, in that the funnel is designed for better flow, and there is no glue between the receptacle and tubing, thus eliminating the problems some people would experience with the glue degrading over time. The tubing/receptacle is a single unit, and made from silicone, making it easy to clean and generally more durable.</p>
<p>STP-FITZ retrofits the Mr. Softie (i.e. Fleshlight) packer, available in two skin tones-- vanilla (light)  and caramel (mid-tone) colors. Unfortunately Mr. Softie is not available in a third, darker skin tone. The Mr. Softie STP Fitz 2.0 is available in two shaft lengths: 3.5-inch (small, $38) and 5-inch (large, $39).</p>
<p><strong>STP-FITZ packers can be purchased through the <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/stp-fitz-stp-fitz-20-stand-to-pee-packer-mr-softie.html">Tool Shed web site</a></strong>, where a number of other products for trans men are also available-- check the &quot;gender expression&quot; link on the left hand page menu for a listing. <strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org.

<p><strong><a name="harnesses"></a>Packing harnesses/pockets <br>
  </strong>This section covers various devices and methods that can be used to
keep a packer or prosthetic in place.</p>
<p><strong>Briefs</strong><br>
  Most packers can be worn &quot;loose&quot; inside a pair of close-fitting briefs;
  however, trouble may be encountered when going to the bathroom or when changing
  clothes in a public setting such as a locker room. If care is not taken the
  packer may fall out, potentially causing confusion and embarrassment (not to
  mention unwanted exposure). Packers can also wiggle out of briefs during exercise
  or due to sudden motion. One solution to this problem is to tie the packer inside
  the toe of a nylon stocking or inside a small, thin sock, and then to attach the stocking/sock to the inside of your briefs with a safety pin.</p>
<p><strong>Jock Strap</strong><br>
  A traditional jock strap (used without a protective cup) can be used to hold
  a packer in place. Jock straps provide a bit more security than simply wearing
  the packer in your briefs (especially in the bathroom), but they are also susceptible
  to the same problem of the packer falling out at an ill-timed moment. As with
  briefs, a solution to this problem is to tie the packer inside the toe of a
  nylon stocking or inside a small, thin sock, and then to securely pin the stocking/sock
  to the inside of the jock strap. Another more secure solution is to use a jock strap that has a pouch built in for a protective cup: you can remove the cup and place the packer securely inside the pouch. </p>
<p>Jock straps come in a variety of styles and with varying thickness in their
  straps. Swimmers' jocks tend to have very thin and unobtrusive straps, which
  may work well under tighter clothing or inside bathing suits.</p>
<p><strong>Performance/compression shorts with pouch </strong><br>
Certain brands of athletic performance shorts, such as compression shorts, have a pouch for a protective cup much like a traditional jock strap. A packer can be placed securely in the pouch of such shorts. Because compression shorts are tight, it is best to pick a brand that is made of a breathable material that will wick away moisture. <a href="http://www.underarmour.com">Under Armour</a> makes a Men's HeatGear Ventilated Compression Short for $29.99 (item 1000025) that features a mesh pouch. You may wish to check your local sporting goods store for similar products. </p>

<p><strong>Basic Packing Pouch</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/twilight-attire-basic-packing-pouch.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Basic Packing Pouch is a simple U-shaped pouch designed to be pinned to the inside waistband of your underwear. The soft cotton pouch keeps the packer completely enclosed and away from your skin. The Basic Packing Pouch is hand-made locally for the Tool Shed. Colors and availability will vary. <strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org.

<p><strong>Basic Packing Jock</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/tool-shed-basic-packing-jock.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Basic Packing Jock takes the simple U-shaped pouch of the Basic Packing Pouch and adds jock-strap style waist and leg straps. The soft cotton pouch keeps the packer completely enclosed and away from your skin. Sizing from X-Small through 3 XL is available. The Basic Packing Jock is hand-made locally for the Tool Shed. Colors and availability will vary. <strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org. The Tool Shed is a trans and partner friendly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tool Belt</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/tool-shed-tool-belt.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Tool Belt is a packing harness made to be compatible for both regular packers as well as STP packers. The specially designed opening in the back of the harness is made so that an STP receptacle (nipple or spoon) can pass through it, and the material of the pouch is designed to fit closely around the testicles of either the Sailor or Fleshlight packers. The Tool Belt is hand-made locally for the Tool Shed. Colors and availability will vary. <strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org.

<p><strong>RodeoH Underwear Harness</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/search/rodeoh/?brand=106093">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
    RodeoH harnesses are designed for use with hard packers/dildos, but many have also found them to be a comfortable and attractive packing solution. RodeoH makes a number of different harness styles in many color options, including briefs, boxer briefs, button-fly boxer briefs, and open back styles. These harnesses are great for packing or playing.</p>
<p><strong>RodeoH Packer Series</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/search/RodeoH+Packer+Series/">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><a href="http://www.toolshedtoys.com/product_info.php/products_id/3992"></a><br>
  The Tool Shed asked RodeoH to make a version of their popular cotton trunks exclusively for soft-packing, and they created the Packer series. These boxer briefs have a secure, u-shaped pouch located on the inside, allowing you to wear your soft packer with confidence and comfort.  The pouch holds the packer securely in place, and keeps the packer from touching your skin, preventing irritation. <strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org.

<p><strong>SpareParts Pete Packing Underwear</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/search/spareparts+pete/">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
Introduced in summer of 2011, Spareparts Pete Packing Underwear offers four different styles of underwear/jocks that are  designed to securely and comfortably hold a soft packer. All four designs are also STP packer compatible. The Commando design ($27.95) is the simplest; it looks much like a jock strap with a hole in the front panel to allow the shaft of the packer to hang free. The Freestyle ($29.95) is similar to the Commando, only with a front panel covering the shaft. The Briefs ($34.95) look much like a traditional pair of men's &quot;tightie whities,&quot; and the Trunks ($36.95) look like a pair of short boxer briefs. All styles are also available in 3-packs. <strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org. The Tool Shed is a trans and partner friendly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Packer Gear Packing Underwear</strong><br>

Packer Gear packing underwear are designed sort of like the traditional RodeoH harness with an open o-ring in front--, but overall they are not not quite to the same level of quality. This is reflected in the price comparison between RodeoH's and Packer Gear. Packer Gear offers a traditional brief and a boxer brief in black. The pocket behind the O-ring has a 2-panel design that will accommodate most STP packers. Available in three sizes, $25 for Briefs and $27 for Boxer Briefs.</p>
<p><strong>Velcro-Top Pouch</strong><br>
  <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/ftm-gear-velcro-top-packing-sack.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a><br>
The Velcro-Top (or V-Top) Pouch is a U-shaped pouch designed with a hole through the front so the shaft of your packer can hang freely. The Pouch has a strip of velcro across the top edge so you can attach it to the inside waistband of your underwear. If your underwear does not take easily to the velcro, you can use an optional safety pin. Made by the Gear Guy of Transitional Male. Available colors will vary.<strong>Note: Purchasing products through the Tool Shed web site directly supports FTMguide.org. The Tool Shed is a trans and partner friendly.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="adhesive"></a>Medical adhesive for prosthetics</strong><br>
  Some silicone prosthetics can be attached 
  to the skin with medical-grade adhesive. Please note that adhesives<strong> 
  cannot</strong> be used with ordinary soft-packers, as the adhesive and the 
  solvent used for removal will quickly damage the material the packer is made 
  out of.<br>
  <br>
  Basic Instructions for using Medical Adhesive for your prosthesis:<br>
  1. Shave the area where the prosthesis is to be attached.<br>
  2. Apply a thin layer of adhesive to the back of the prosthesis (where it will
  only come into contact with the pubic area).<br>
  3. Wait until the adhesive begins to dry (this should take 1 to 2 minutes).<br>
  4. Press the prosthetic firmly onto the pubic area<br>
  5. Hold in place for 60 seconds.<br>
  6. Apply a new layer of adhesive or as needed.<br>
  7. Use appropriate removal solvent with a cotton ball to remove adhesive.</p>
<p> The adhesive can be purchased through the three prosthetics makers listed
