This may actually be a blessing   in disguise, because sometimes our father's techniques of shaving are not terribly   good for the skin!</p><p>This chapter contains numerous sections on the topic of shaving, including   shaving tips and methods, basic information about shavers and shaving products,   and advice for guys with sensitive skin who experience problems with ingrown   hairs or razor bumps.</p><hr><p><a name="methods"></a><strong>Shaving Methods</strong></p><p><a name="wetshaving"></a><strong>Wet Shaving</strong></p><p>Wet shaving as described below refers to shaving done with a disposable razor   or a safety razor. These rules also apply if you happen to be using a straight   razor, but there are additional specifics to consider regarding straight razors  (<a href="#straight">click   here to read about straight razors</a>).</p><p>Throughout the wet shaving section, you'll find exceptions and tips noted for   men who suffer from razor bumps and ingrown hairs. There is an additional section   devoted to this topic as an addendum to the wet shaving section. If you suffer   from razor bumps or ingrown hairs, be sure to read<strong> both</strong> sections,   as the combination of proper wet shaving technique plus the use of special sensitive   skin products and tips will often clear up the problem.</p><p>Keep in mind that much of the advice for wet shaving does not apply to those   using electric shavers; see the section on electric shavers for specific advice   on that topic.</p><p><strong>Before you shave: waking up the skin</strong><br>  When you first wake up in the morning, your skin tends to be puffy and swollen.   If you shave in the mornings, wait until at least 20 minutes after you have   woken up before you begin your shave to let the puffiness go down. When your   skin has reached its normal tautness, the hairs will be closer to the surface   and easier to shave.</p><p><strong>Pre-shave cleansing </strong><br>  Some skin care experts recommend cleansing your face with a facial soap before   shaving to help remove dead skin and excess dirt and oil, thus freeing up any   ingrown hairs and preventing the clogging of your razor. If you do cleanse your   face before shaving, don't  wash with ordinary soap, as it will dry your   skin. Use warm water and a facial soap or cleansing scrub designed for men's   skin.</p><p>If you have problems with ingrown hairs or razor bumps, and you may wish to   use a pre-shave cleansing product specifically designed to prevent those problems   (<a href="#sensitive">see the section on &quot;Sensitive Skin&quot; for more   tips on avoiding razor bumps and ingrown hairs</a>).</p><p><strong>Warm water prep</strong><br>  Even if you choose to skip the pre-shave wash, be sure to use warm water to   thoroughly wet your face before applying your shaving cream or gel. Massaging   your face with warm water makes the skin more pliable and opens the pores, plus   it helps soften your whiskers. Soft, wet whiskers tend to be easier to shave.  </p><p>You can easily accomplish this task by showering <em>before </em>you shave.   Avoid using extremely hot water, as it might dry out your skin.</p><p>Applying a warm, wet towel or washcloth to your face for a few minutes can   also help soften your hair and open your pores. For men with very coarse whiskers,   you may want to apply the hot towel a few times in succession to really loosen   things up.</p><p><strong>Applying shaving cream/gel/shave soap</strong><br>  After applying warm water to the face, add a cream, shave soap, or gel that is specifically designed for shaving. Don't   use ordinary soap to lather your face, as it will dry out your skin. Avoid low-quality   foams, as they tend to be less effective than creams or gels and also may dry   your skin.</p><p>Apply your cream or gel by massaging it in a thin, even layer. If you are using   a glycerin-based shave soap, apply an even layer using a badger bristle shave   brush (<a href="#brushes">click here for details on shave brushes</a>). The   idea is to use enough cream or gel to lubricate your skin and soften your beard   while helping the razor glide smoothly with minimal irritation; too much cream   or gel will cause your razor to skip and clog. </p><p><strong>Applying shave oil</strong><br>  As with gels and creams, thoroughly wet your face with warm water. Put 4 to   5 drops of shaving oil in your hand and massage it into your face. Keep the   face wet while you shave; if it is drying out, massage in more water. Shaving   oils are different from gels and foams in that you cannot easily see where you   have applied them. This is good if you are creating a goatee or side burns,   as you can see exactly what you are doing. It can be bad if you forget where   you already shaved, as you don't want to irritate the same spot by shaving over   it repeatedly.</p><p>You can also apply a pre-shave oil as a first layer, underneath shaving creams   and gels, to help soften the beard and improve the quality of the shave.</p><p><strong><a name="grain"></a>Go with the grain</strong><br>  When wet shaving, it is best to shave &quot;with the grain&quot; of   your hair growth. Which way is with the grain? Rub your hand on your   stubbly face. In one direction it will feel more rough than in the other and   will resist the push of your hand-- kind of like when you rub a cat backwards!   That rough direction is against the grain, while the other, smoother-feeling   direction is &quot;with the grain.&quot; On your cheeks and chin, this will   tend to be downward. On your neck, this will tend to be upward, though everyone's   hair growth varies. Some men's facial hair swirls in certain patches. The best   way to find the grain direction is to shave and then let your stubble grow back   for a couple of days, and rub.</p><p>Why shave with the grain? Because there is less of a chance of nicks and cuts,   and because it reduces the chance of ingrown hairs and razor bumps. When you   shave against the grain, the razor's blade catches aginst the hair and pulls   it slightly further away from the surface of the skin. This results in an increased   likelihood of shaving the hair at a level slightly below your skin's surface (one reason why ingrown hairs develop). Also, when you shave you are not simply   taking off hair, you are taking off a fine layer of skin (also called &quot;exfoliating&quot;).   Shaving with the grain tends to be a little easier on your skin as well; the razor tends to travel a smoother path with the grain of hair growth.</p><p>If you've been shaving against the grain up until this point, then  it might   take some time to get a close shave by going with the grain. Keep trying; your   face may take a week or two to adjust to a new method of shaving.</p><p>You might have some particularly stubborn stubble that needs to be shaved against   the grain (or sideways <strong>across</strong> the grain, which is a little   less harmful than directly against the grain) in order to attain a close shave.   If that is the case, shave as much as you can with the grain, then re-lather   and shave those trouble areas across or against the grain. Some guys use this   method for a really, really close shave. If you try this approach, remember   to re-lather and repeat only after getting through your first shave <em>with</em> the grain.</p><p>If you are prone to ingrown hairs/razor bumps, avoid this practice at all costs   as it will most likely make the problem worse.</p><p><strong>Shaving method</strong><br>  Be methodical when you shave-- don't just shave here and there, as you will   miss spots or go over the same spot too many times. A good method is to begin   with your side burns, cheeks, and neck. Finish with the upper lip and chin,   where the whiskers tend to be heavier. Saving them until last will allow the   cream or gel to soften them more.</p><p>While you are shaving, use your free hand to <em>gently </em>pull the skin   taut to avoid nicks. If you pull your skin to be very taut, you will get a closer   shave; however, if you suffer from razor bumps/ingrown hairs you might want   to avoid pulling the skin too tightly, as you'll risk cutting the hairs slightly   below skin level.</p><p>Try not to repeat strokes, as this can irritate your skin. Make sure you lift   the blade after each stroke, thus reducing the chance of cuts and nicks. Don't   press too hard-- your razor should glide over your face. If you have to press   too hard it is time for a new blade.</p><p><strong>Rinse your razor as you go</strong><br>  Regularly rinse your razor in hot water. If necessary, tap it on the sink to   dislodge clogged hair and cream or gel (but avoid tapping the blade directly,   as this will obviously dull it). A clogged blade will not perform well.</p><p><strong>Rinse your face with cool water</strong><br>  When you are done shaving rinse off excess cream with cool water. Gently pat   your face dry. Do not rub. </p><p><strong>Apply toner or aftershave balm</strong><br>  Avoid using alcohol-based aftershave, as it will dry out your skin. Instead,   apply a balm or toner with ingredients that will moisturize and nourish your   skin. After-shave toners help remove any residue left over from shaving, close   the pores, and refresh the skin.</p><p>If you have problems with acne, find an aftershave product that is &quot;non-comedogenic&quot; (meaning it will not clog your pores). If you have   problems with ingrown hairs/razor bumps, you may want to use a product designed   specifically to combat that problem.</p><p><strong>Caring for your blade</strong><br>  Rinse out your razor carefully with hot water at the end of your shave. Allow   the razor to air dry naturally; drying it on a towel can dull the blade.</p><p>Blades should be changed every 4-6 shaves, or more frequently if you have a   very coarse beard. A dull blade will cause you to push down harder in order   to be effective, pulling at your hairs and skin and causing irritation and possibly   ingrown hairs.</p><p><strong>If you've cut yourself shaving</strong><br>  Use a styptic pencil (made primarily of alum) or an alum block to dab on the   affected area to stop the blood flow. Alum has astringent properties (it closes   pores), and has been used by men for years to help heal shaving nicks.</p><p>There are a couple of other products on the market to heal shaving cuts, including   roll-on products that contain natural ingredients such as aloe. These can be   a more soothing alternative to the styptic pencil.</p><p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p><hr><p><strong><a name="sensitive"></a>Sensitive skin:<br>  Preventing razor burn, rashes, and ingrown hairs/razor bumps</strong></p><p>Before trying to treat sensitive skin problems that arise due to shaving, it   is important to diagnose each problem correctly. Described below are four common   problems caused by shaving or shaving products.</p><p><strong>Razor burn</strong><br>  Razor burn is a temporary irritation, redness or swelling of the skin. If you   dry shave, shave without adequate cream or gel, or shave too hard or too fast,   your skin will likely show some irritation. If you're suffering from razor burn,   look for a soothing after-shave balm. Avoid alcohol-based aftershaves. You also   may also want to avoid shaving for a few days in order to let the skin heal   itself. Razor burn should go away in a few days, and it is easily prevented   through the methods outlined in the &quot;<a href="#wetshaving">Wet Shaving</a>&quot;   section.</p><p><strong>Rashes (other than razor burn)</strong><br>  Rashes other than razor burn can be caused by allergic or other adverse reactions   to the skin/shaving products you are using. If you believe this to be the case,   try unscented products and/or products designed specifically for sensitive skin.   Definitely stop splashing on alcohol-based after-shaves and colognes. Use an   after-shave balm that soothes the skin with natural ingredients and no heavy   scents.</p><p><strong>Razor bumps/ingrown hairs</strong><br>  Razor bumps and ingrown hairs are medically known as &quot;pseudofolliculitis   barbae.&quot; <strong>Razor bumps</strong> result from a <em>hair growing out   of the skin, curling around and then growing back in</em>. <strong>Ingrown hairs   </strong>form when <em>hair, growing back after shaving, fails to grow out of   the follicle</em>.</p><p>In either case, hairs lodged in the skin cause inflammation, followed   by pus formation. Psuedofolliculitis barbae appear as tender, red, raised bumps.   For this reason, they are sometimes mistaken for acne. If you are unable to   tell if you are experiencing acne or pseudofolliculitis barbae, ask your doctor   or dermatologist for help in diagnosing your problem.</p><p><strong>Preventing razor bumps and ingrown hairs</strong><br>  In order to prevent razor bumps and ingrown hairs, you should follow the basic   shaving advice given in the &quot;<a href="#wetshaving">Wet Shaving</a>&quot;   section (with exceptions as noted therein for sensitive skin). Also keep in   mind the additional shaving pointers listed below.</p><p><strong>Find the right razor and products for <em>your</em> skin</strong><br>  For wet shaving, try switching to a single blade razor, as double and triple   blades tend to pull up on the whisker and then cut it below the epidermis (the   top layer of the skin).</p><p>If an ordinary single blade does not seem to help, specialized razors have   been developed to cut the hair slightly longer than typical razors. Product   lines such as the &quot;Bump Fighter Shaving System&quot; include such razors,   as well as pre-shave and after-shave products that help with tough cases of   razor bumps. Other specialty razors have been developed to shave sensitive areas   of the face and body, and those may also be appropriate for preventing razor   bumps.</p><p>Razor bumps tend to be a more serious problem for men with kinky or curly hair,   especially Black men. As such, there are a number of products that have been   designed and marketed specifically for Black men to reduce and prevent razor   bumps (<a href="#powders">see also the section on &quot;Shaving Powders/Depilatories&quot;</a>).   Men of all colors who suffer from razor bumps may benefit from exploring these   product lines.</p><p>Some men who suffer from ingrown hairs claim that electric shavers are helpful   to them, yet other men say that electric shavers make the problem worse. You   may wish to try an electric razor if the proper wet shaving methods have failed   to solve your problem. Keep in mind that many electric shavers have a money-back   guarantee, so you may be able to try one with minimal financial risk (<a href="#electric">see   more details in the &quot;Electric Shavers&quot; section</a>).</p><p><strong>Use an exfoliating facial cleanser</strong><br>  Use a cleanser designed to exfoliate your skin at least once or twice a week   to remove dead cells and help free up trapped hair. You may also want to try   a pre-shave cleanser or treatment designed specifically for prevention of razor   bumps and ingrown hairs.</p><p><strong>Thoroughly wet your beard before shaving</strong><br>  This is generally a good rule in any case, but especially so for those with   ingrown hair problems. Make sure your beard has been wetted with warm water   for at least 5 minutes before shaving. A good time to shave is immediately after   you shower. Wetter hair is much easier to shave, and thus your razor will cause   less pulling and irritation.</p><p><strong>Shave with the grain of your hair growth</strong><br>  This is so important it bears repeating. Review the tips about shaving with   the grain in the previous &quot;<a href="#wetshaving">Wet Shaving</a>&quot;   section.</p><p><strong>Minimize repeat shaving strokes</strong><br>  Fewer strokes means less irritation and less chance of cutting the hairs too   close.</p><p><strong>Shave with the skin in a neutral relaxed position</strong><br>  This is the best way to shave your beard close, but not too close. Excessive   pulling and stretching of the skin causes the hair to protrude a bit farther   out than normal. Shaving over stretched skin may cut the hairs below the surface   of resting skin, thus increasing the risk of ingrown hairs.</p><p><strong>Use shaving gels and aftershave balms specifically designed to prevent   razor bumps</strong><br>  As mentioned previously, product lines have been specifically designed for men   who suffer from razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</p><p><strong>Avoid shaving over already irritated razor bumps</strong><br>  Shaving over bumps might cause them to bleed and become more inflamed. If possible,   you might want to avoid shaving for a few days and try a skin product regimen   designed to dislodge and soothe ingrown hairs before you begin shaving again.</p><p><strong>How to dislodge ingrown hairs</strong><br>  Using a cleanser featuring glycolic acid before you shave can help dislodge   ingrown hairs. Glycolic acid helps remove dead skin. You can also try to dislodge   them by <em>very gently </em>rubbing a clean, soft-bristled toothbrush or clean,   rough washcloth over the affected area in a circular motion.</p><p>In some instances the hair may grow out of the follicle but become trapped   under a fine layer of skin. For hairs that you can clearly see growing along   under the skin, simply free them up with a sharp pair of <strong>sterilized</strong>   tweezers (sterilize with alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or boiling in water for   15 minutes). Do not pick them out with your fingers, as this will probably make   the problem worse. Also, do not pluck the hair all the way out, just set it   free and let the area heal.</p><p><strong>The easiest solution: grow your beard</strong><br>  Perhaps the easiest way to avoid razor bumps and ingrown hairs is to grow out   a beard or goatee. You may need to follow a skin regimen to help loosen and   free up previously ingrown hairs, but once they are out they should no longer   pose a problem, and your skin should heal nicely.</p><p><strong>See a dermatologist</strong><br>  If over-the-counter solutions and using proper shaving methods do not help clear   up your skin and ingrown hair problems, it might be helpful to seek the advice   of a dermatologist.</p><p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p><hr><p><a name="powders" id="powders"></a><strong>Shaving powders/depilatories</strong></p><p>There are a few brands of shaving powders on the market that have been formulated   for Black men to help stop razor bumps-- these can usually be found in the shaving   section of your drugstore. Shaving powders are used instead of a razor; they   chemically cause the hair to be removed from the skin.</p><p>Men of all colors might find success with shaving powder. However, the key   for <em>all</em> men is to test the product on a small area of the face to make   sure there is no adverse reaction or irritation associated with the product.   Depilatories can be irritating to those with sensitive skin.</p><p>You should always follow the specific instructions on the label for the shaving   powder you have chosen. In general, the process involves mixing up a couple   of tablespoons of powder with an equal amount of cool water to create a soft   paste. You then apply the paste mixture over the area of your beard, without   rubbing it in. Allow the paste to remain on the beard for 3-5 minutes, then   remove with a spatula using smooth strokes (avoid scraping). <strong>Do not leave on the skin for more than 5 minutes</strong>, as the skin may become irritated or burned.   Wash thoroughly with cold water and make sure that all of the product has been   removed from your skin. Avoid contact with the eyes, and do not use within 36   hours of shaving.</p><p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p><hr><p><a name="electric"></a><strong>Electric Shavers</strong></p><p>Unlike blades, electric shavers work by shearing the whiskers--the hair enters   the perforated metal heads or foils of the shaver and is cut by the moving blades   inside. Most electric shavers are dry shavers (i.e. they don't require shaving   gel or water), though there are some wet/dry electric models on the market.   This guide covers the more common dry shaver models; if you do choose a wet/dry   model, follow the specific instructions of your model for use and care.</p><p>Benefits of dry electric shaving are ease of use and less chance of cuts and   scrapes. It is debatable as to whether wet blade shaving or electric shaving   is faster, but some men find that the electric shaver is less messy and more   convenient.</p><p><strong>First-time electric shaver users</strong><br>  If you are new to shaving, or have been using a blade razor and are switching   to electric, give your face 2-3 weeks to adjust to electric shaving. Also, don't   fluctuate back and forth between blade shaving and electric shaving during that   period if you can help it. Though your first few shaves may be less than perfect,   many men report that once their face has gotten &quot;used to&quot; the electric   shaver, it works very well for them.</p><p>During your trial and error process of finding the right shaver, keep in mind   that many brands of electric shavers have money back guarantees. Be sure to   check the guarantee for the shaver you purchase and plan accordingly.</p><p><strong>Types of dry electric shavers</strong><br>  There are two major types of electric shavers: <strong>foil shavers</strong>   and <strong>rotary shavers</strong>. Personal preference and trial and error   will determine which type is better for you.</p><p>Foil shavers use an oscillating (back and forth) motion to cut hairs through   a foil (also know as a screen). The blades in a foil shaver are positioned in   line; they may contain 1-4 rows of blades. Single foil shavers have one cutter   covered by one foil. These are ideal for men who are just starting to shave   or those with slow beard growth. Double foil shavers have two cutters covered   by two foils; triple foil shavers have three cutters covered by three foils,   etc.</p><p>Rotary shavers use a cutting system based upon circular blades that rotate   under a slotted head or heads. They may contain 1-3 rotating blades and heads,   and the heads may be designed to swivel with the contours of your face.</p><hr><p><strong>Electric Shaving Methods</strong><br>  <strong>Preparation</strong><br>  Dry electric shavers require the opposite of what you want when preparing for   a traditional wet shave with a blade. With an electric shaver, you want the   hairs to be dry and stiff before you begin, so they are easier to shear once   they've gotten inside the heads of the shaver. Because of this, you should <em>not</em>   start by washing your face or thoroughly wetting the beard with water.</p><p>Instead, you may want to prep with a pre-shave lotion designed for electric   shavers (such as &quot;Lectric Shave&quot;). Such products, often alcohol-based,   dry up the oils and moisture on your skin and make the whiskers stand straight   up.</p><p><strong>General rules</strong><br>  When using an electric shaver you can shave either against the grain of your   whiskers or with the grain (see the &quot;Wet Shaving&quot; section for information   on <a href="#grain">finding the grain of your beard growth</a>). In the case   of a rotary shaver, make small circular motions with the shaver head on your   face. Be sure to use gentle pressure-- do not move rapidly, and do not press   down hard. Let the shaver do the work for you. If you have to press down hard,   your shaver may be dirty, and/or your blades may be too dull and need to be   replaced.</p><p><strong>Hints for sensitive skin</strong><br>  If you have sensitive skin, you may wish to shave the more sensitive areas of   your face and neck first, and finish with the less sensitive areas. This is   because some electric shavers generate heat over the course of your shave, and   heat can cause irritation. Shave sensitive areas while the shaver is still cool.</p><p><strong>Finishing up</strong><br>  When you are finished, if there is any pre-shave lotion remaining, rinse your   face with warm water, then cool water. Pat your face dry (don't rub) and apply   an after-shave balm or moisturizer to smooth the skin. As with wet shaving,   avoid alcohol-based after-shaves, and instead look for products designed to   soothe and moisturize your skin without clogging your pores.</p><hr><p><strong>Electric Shaver Maintenance</strong><br>  <strong>Don't throw away the manual!</strong><br>  Take the time to read your shaver manual regarding its proper use, upkeep, and   maintenance. Below are some general tips for proper shaver maintenance; however,   these should not replace the tips given in the manual for your specific model.</p><p><strong>Clean your shaver's screen and cutter regularly</strong><br>  On most shavers you can lift off the head frame which holds the screen in order   to brush out any whisker residue. The shaver should come with a cleaning brush   designed for this purpose. The cutter, located below the screen, is the area   you need to brush out. Do not touch the screen itself with the brush; it is   very fragile. It is best to clean your shaver at least every third shave, preferably   more frequently. You can also use a specialized cleaning solution as recommended   by the manufacturer for a really thorough cleaning. </p><p><strong>The screen and cutter need lubrication</strong><br>  Spray a lubricant (there are plenty designed and recommended by shaver manufacturers)   on the shaving screen while the shaver is running. This will free up any metal-to-metal   binding that may be impeding the shaver's effectiveness. Use the lubricant sparingly,   and apply as directed by the manufacturer. It is best to lubricate the cutter   just before you shave. You don't need to wipe off excess lubricant.</p><p><strong>Changing your foil and cutter</strong><br>  Most foil and cutter sets need to be changed about once per year; sooner if   you have a tough beard or if you don't clean out and lubricate your shaver frequently   enough. Change the foil and cutter at the same time. As your cutter gets duller,   your foil gradually gets thinner as well. Installing a new, sharp cutter under a thinning foil can break a hole in the foil, and you could possibly be cut. </p><p><a href="#top">back to the top </a> </p><hr><p><a name="straight"></a><strong>Straight Razors</strong></p><p>The straight razor is constructed of a long, hardened steel blade attached   to a handle by means of a pivot. The handle is typically made of hard rubber,   plastic, or bone. You may have seen one in your old-style local barbershop,   or in an old movie&#8212;or perhaps you know someone who uses one on a regular   basis.</p><p>A straight razor is a classic shaving implement, and one that is not as commonly   used since the invention of the safety razor. However, some men still enjoy   shaving with a straight razor, and so can you if you are  inclined to do a   little research on straight razor care and technique.</p><p>One advantage of a straight razor is that, if properly cared for, the blade   can last for generations. Unlike disposable blades, which we simply throw away   after a few shaves when they become too dull to use, straight razors are frequently   &quot;stropped&quot; and periodically &quot;honed&quot; to maintain their sharp   cutting edge. If you choose a straight razor, you should be prepared to spend   some quality time maintaining it in order to get an effective shave.</p><p>When shopping for a straight razor, you should look for a shop that deals with   high quality shaving equipment and/or high quality knives. Ideally, find a shop   where the salespeople actually use the products they sell, so that they can   provide you with quality advice on using and maintaining your razor.</p><p>For your first straight razor, it is probably best to avoid buying the most   expensive model (in case you give up on the whole thing). Nor is it wise to   buy the cheapest model (a poor quality razor can keep you from getting a good   shave and enjoying the experience). Buy a razor that balances quality and price.   Discuss with your salesperson which choice might be best for you and your beard-type.</p><p><strong>Important points to consider with your salesperson when buying a straight   razor are:</strong></p><blockquote>  <p><strong>Balance</strong><br>    The balance refers to the relative weight and length of the blade as compared     with that of the handle. A straight razor is properly balanced when the weight     of the blade is equal to that of the handle.<br>    <strong>Temper</strong><br>    Tempering the razor involves a heat treatment imparted to the blade during     its manufacture. Razors can be purchased with either a hard, soft, or medium     temper, each with its own set of pros and cons.<br>    <strong>Size</strong><br>    The size of the razor refers to the length and width of the blade. <br>    <strong>Grind</strong><br>    The grind of a razor refers to the shape of the blade. There are two basic     types of grind: the concave grind and the wedge grind.<br>    <strong>Finish</strong><br>    The finish of a razor is the condition of its surface, which may be either     plain steel, crocus (polished steel) or metal plated (nickel or silver). The     crocus finish usually lasts longer and shows the least rust of the three.     <br>    <strong>Style</strong><br>    The style simply refers to the overall design and look of the razor.</p></blockquote><p>In addition to purchasing the straight razor itself, you must also buy a few   additional items in order to maintain the blade:</p><p><strong>Strop </strong><br>  All straight razors require daily stropping before and after use to straighten   and re-align their edge. Individuals with coarse beards may also need to strop   their razors during a shaving session. Stropping involves passing the blade   in a back-and-forth motion over a strop, which is usually made of leather. Strops   come in both belt and paddle styles. Belts often have a leather side and a linen/cotton   side, while paddles can have 2, 3, or 4 sides.</p><p><strong>Strop paste</strong><br>  Strop paste is a leather conditioner that is used to protect and condition the   leather strop, while improving stropping by causing additional drag on the razor.   There are several strop pastes available, usually in different colors, and each   has a different purpose. When choosing your stop, discuss with the salesperson   which strop paste is right for you.<br>  <br>  <strong>Hone</strong><br>  Even with daily stropping, all razors lose their edge over time. To replace   the edge you will need to periodically hone your razor. Honing re-establishes   the fine edge of the razor by actually removing some of the metal from the razor   (as opposed to stropping, which simply reshapes the edge). Ask your salesperson   for a recommendation on how often you should hone the razor you choose. As a   general rule, you should hone your razor when it starts to drag on your face,   even after you have stropped it properly. Always use a hone specifically designed   for razors (not for kitchen or hunting knives), with a minimum of 6,000 grit   (8,000-10,000 is preferred).</p><p>Consult with your salesperson or an experienced straight razor user on proper   stropping and honing techniques. A traditional barbershop textbook may also   provide detailed examples of honing techniques.</p><p>For online guides to use and care of your straight razor, including stropping   and honing techniques, see the &quot;<a href="#links">Shaving-Related Links</a>&quot; at the end of this page.<br></p><p><strong>Straight razor care</strong><br>  In addition to stropping and honing, care should be taken to prevent corrosion   from forming on the razor. With this in mind, you should rinse your razor after   each use and allow it to  air dry thoroughly before putting it away. Keep the   blade lubricated with a light grade oil after each shaving session.</p><p><strong>Straight razor shaving tips</strong><br>  All of the advice provided in the &quot;wet shaving&quot; section applies to   the straight razor section as well. However, there are a few techniques specific   to straight razor shaving that are described below.</p><p>Many men report they get the best results with a straight razor used in combination   with a traditional shaving brush and a glycerin-based shave soap. (<a href="#brushes">Click   here for more information on the use of shave brushes and shave soap</a>.)</p><p>Once you have prepped your face and beard in the manner described in the &quot;wet   shaving&quot; section, open your razor to 270 degrees, so the handle is pointed   up and the blade edge is pointed down. This position allows for good control   while shaving. Run the blade under hot water just before use. Begin with the   side-burns and cheeks, then the neck, then the upper lip and chin.</p><p>One of the great benefits of a straight razor is that you can adjust the blade   angle for different parts of the beard and face. When you are first starting   to shave with a straight razor, begin with a more forgiving blade angle of around   90 degrees against the skin. Once you have learned to handle the razor adeptly,   you may try more aggressive angles, up to about 30 degrees. The razor should   glide smoothly over your face. Rinse the razor under hot running water frequently   to remove oil, soap, and hair.</p><p>Be careful to never move the razor in a cutting motion parallel to the blade   edge; you will cut yourself. Also be careful to not hit your razor on the sink   as this could permanently damage the razor's edge.</p><p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p><hr><p><a name="tools"></a><strong>Wet Shaving Tools</strong></p><p><a name="disposable"></a><strong>Disposable razors</strong><br>  A major advantage to disposables is that they are convenient and readily available.   One drawback is they involve a lot of waste-- either the entire razor is thrown   away in the case of one-piece disposables, or the cartridges are thrown away   in the case of disposables where you keep the razor handle. Plus, cartridges   tend to be more expensive than buying individual blades. If you've found a specific   brand that works well for you, by all means stick with it. However, if you are   considering costs over a lifetime of use, a quality double-edged safety razor   with replaceable blades might save you money in the long run.</p><p><a name="safety"></a><strong>Double-edge (non-disposable) safety razors</strong><br>  The double-edge safety razor is a great value among wet shavers. This type of   shaver has a sturdy handle and a shave head that are typically made of metal.   The user can open the metal head and insert a new double-edged replacement blade   once the old one has become dull. Replacement blades are inexpensive, easy to   find, and provide two shaving edges per blade, so they last twice as long. These   razors provide a clean, close shave, and if properly cared for, there is no   reason why a well-made safety razor shouldn't last a lifetime.</p><p><strong>Straight razor</strong><br>  See the <a href="#straight">previous section</a> for details on the straight   razor.</p><p><a name="brushes"></a><strong>Shave brushes</strong><br>  The shave brush is an important part of the shaving process that has been left   behind by many in recent times, but it is a wonderful tool for preparing the face   for shaving.</p><p>The best quality shave brushes are made from 100% badger hair. Badger hair   is very fibrous and retains a large volume of water, which is key to producing   a warm, rich, and lubricating lather for an exceptional shave. Shave brushes   are also made from synthetic fibers (the least expensive and least effective),   boar bristle (better than synthetic, not as good as badger), or synthetic/natural   blends, but badger hair works the best of them all. Badger hair brushes are   then graded into three categories: Pure badger (least expensive of the badgers),   Best badger (more expensive than Pure badger), and Silvertip badger or &quot;Super   badger&quot; (most expensive of all).</p><p>If cared for properly, shave brushes should last many years, so it may be wise   to invest in a Pure badger brush ($20-$80) as it will perform well for some   time. If your budget constrains you from being able to go with a badger brush,   Boar bristle brushes tend to be comparable in price to synthetic brushes, but   usually far outperform them.</p><p>Shave brushes are typically used in combination with a glycerin-based shave soap   and a shave mug (see below), though you can use them with shave creams as well.   To work a shave soap into a lather inside your shave mug, first drench the brush   bristles with warm water. Brush the shave soap in a circular, whisking motion   with the shave brush until a rich lather forms. Do not press down on the bristles,   as this may damage the brush-- simply move in quick circular motions.</p><p>The lather you create with a shave brush and shave soap will not be thick   like the foam that comes out of a shaving cream can. It will be a thinner, yet   rich lather. If you seem to be getting what looks like bubble water, you either   haven't worked the lather enough, or you added a bit too much water. Experiment   until you produce a good lather.</p><p>Use the brush to apply the lather to your beard in small, gentle, circular   motions, or in gentle painting motions. Do not press the bristles hard against   your face, as this could damage the brush. The action of the brush helps lift   the hairs while laying down a slippery barrier of lather. This barrier reduces   razor drag and skippage. You can renew the lather on your face while shaving   by simply reworking the lather with the shave brush.</p><p>Always rinse your brush well under warm water after each use and gently flick   out the excess water. Stand the brush upright in a dry environment or place   it on a shave brush stand, allowing it to air dry fully after each use. Never   put a wet shave brush in an enclosed place. A very basic brush stand costs about   $4-5, and will keep your brush in good condition for years to come.</p><p><a name="soaps"></a><strong>Shave soaps</strong><br>  A good shave soap can used along with a shave brush make a difference in the   feel and closeness of your shave. A basic, glycerin-based shave soap will generate   a rich, slippery lather for a close shave, and has a few other virtues as well:   it is biodegradeable and there is no canister to discard nor propellants released   into the air. Shave soaps also tend to be inexpensive.</p><p>Shave soaps look like ordinary soap (white or colored) in the shape of a hockey   puck. Some shave soaps come in their own special bowl-like containers, but it   is usually less messy to use a shave soap and brush with a shave mug.</p><p><a name="mugs"></a><strong>Shave mugs</strong><br>  Shave mugs look like ordinary mugs except they are larger overall, and wider   at their opening than at the bottom. This allows for room to put the shave soap   in the bottom of the mug, as well as room to whip the soap into a lather with   your shave brush.</p><p><a href="#top">back to the top </a></p><hr><p><a name="links"></a><strong>Shaving-Related Links</strong></p><p>Sites with excellent shaving information, in addtion to selling shaving products:<br>  <a href="http://www.classicshaving.com">www.classicshaving.com</a><br>  <a href="http://premiumknives.com/ShopSite/Shaving_Razors_and_stropes_and_Shaving_Accessories.html">premiumknives.com/ShopSite/Shaving_Razors_and_stropes_and_Shaving_Accessories.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gentlemans-shop.com">www.gentlemans-shop.com</a><br><a href="http://www.vintagebladesllc.com">www.vintagebladesllc.com</a></p><p>Extensive information on straight razors and wet shaving:<br>  <a href="http://www.en.NassRasur.com/razorcentral/index.html">www.en.NassRasur.com/razorcentral/index.html</a> (this one has really extensive instructions)<br>  <a href="http://www.classicshaving.citymax.com">www.classicshaving.citymax.com</a><br>  <a href="http://premiumknives.com/ShopSite/Shaving_Razors_and_stropes_and_Shaving_Accessories.html">premiumknives.com/ShopSite/Shaving_Razors_and_stropes_and_Shaving_Accessories.html</a> (click on the &quot;Straight Razors&quot; section)<br>  <a href="http://www.gentlemans-shop.com">www.gentlemans-shop.com</a><br><a href="http://www.knifecenter.com/knifecenter/sharpen/instrazor.html">www.knifecenter.com/knifecenter/sharpen/instrazor.html</a></p><p>The following is a link to a yahoo groups site for straight razor users:<br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/straightrazorplace/">health.groups.yahoo.com/group/straightrazorplace</a></p><p>Site with numerous hard-to-find men's classic toiletries and shaving supplies:<br>  <a href="http://www.e-barbershop.com">www.e-barbershop.com</a></p><p>Sites selling classic and contemporary shaving products:<br>  <a href="http://www.coolshaving.com">www.coolshaving.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazingshaving.com">www.amazingshaving.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shaveshop.com">www.shaveshop.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shavingsupplies.com">www.shavingsupplies.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nashvilleknifeshop.com">www.nashvilleknifeshop.com</a></p><p><strong><span class="style1">Was this page helpful to you?</span><br>Please consider <a href="donate.html">donating</a> to ftmguide.org! </strong></p><p><a href="#top">back to the top</a><br></p><p><a href="index.html">Back to Hudson's FTM Resource Guide main page</a></p><p><a href="copyright.html">Copyright, disclaimer, and privacy information</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
