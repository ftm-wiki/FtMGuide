<p><a name="overview"></a><strong>Overview</strong><br>
  In FTM testosterone therapy, testosterone (often called &quot;T&quot; for 
  short) can be administered into the body in a number of ways. The most common 
  method is injection (either subcutaneous or intermuscular) with a syringe. Other delivery methods include transdermal 
  application through gel, cream, or patch applied to the skin; orally by swallowing 
  tablets (this method is very uncommon as it has been shown to have negative effects 
  on the liver); sublingually/buccally by dissolving a tablet under the tongue 
  or against the gums; or by a pellet inserted under the skin. The T-delivery 
  method used will depend on the type of medication available in the country of 
  treatment, the health risks/benefits for the patient, personal preference, and cost.</p>
<p>Testosterone is not stored by the body for future use, so in order to maintain 
  healthy levels, it must be administered in timed intervals and in appropriate 
  dosages. Injectable and subcutaneous T pellets remain active in the body the 
  longest. Injectable T is typically administered between once a week to once 
  every three weeks, and subcutaneous T pellets are replaced every 3-4 months. 
  Transdermal T (patch, gel, or cream) is typically applied to the skin in smaller 
  daily doses; oral and sublingual/buccal T are also typically taken daily. </p>
<p><b><a name="tlevels"></a>&quot;Normal&quot; testosterone Levels<br>
  </b>An individual's testosterone levels are usually confirmed through a blood 
  test called a &quot;serum total testosterone test.&quot; Testosterone exists 
  in your bloodstream in two forms-- &quot;bound&quot; testosterone and &quot;free&quot; 
  testosterone. The majority of bound testosterone in the body is chemically bound 
  to a protein called &quot;sex hormone binding globulin&quot; (SHBG). The remaining 
  bound testosterone in the system is mostly bound to albumin, another protein. 
  Free testosterone is not chemically attached to any proteins and is considered the &quot;active&quot; form of testosterone, as it is readily available 
  to bind to androgen receptor sites on cells.</p>
<p>A serum total testosterone test measures the total of bound and free T in the system. What is considered a normal test level of combined bound and free testosterone 
  in male bodies can range anywhere from 300-1100 ng/dl (nanograms per deciliter). 
  Levels will vary with age and individual factors.</p>
<p>It is useful to also separately measure the level of free testosterone in the system, 
  as this may be more indicative of how hormone therapy is progressing. Levels 
  of free testosterone can range between 0.3%-5% of the total testosterone count, 
  with about 2% considered an optimal level. Ask your doctor to check for both 
  total and free levels of testosterone in your system.</p>
<p> Remember that because everyone's bodies have differing sensitivities to androgens, 
  T levels themselves will not necessarily indicate results in terms of masculinization. 
  The levels are merely a guideline by which you and your doctor can begin to 
  measure progress. Your results and your dosing should be guided by your overall 
  health (especially the health of your heart and liver), your progress in masculinization, 
  and how your body and moods react to different dosages. Testosterone therapy 
  is not a one-size-fits-all approach-- be sure to monitor your health and feelings 
  closely, and remember that even a small adjustment in dosage (either increase or decrease) 
  can make a big difference.</p>
<p><b><a name="takemore"></a>A note of caution about greatly increasing your T 
  dosage</b><br>
  During the first months of T therapy, many trans men feel impatient waiting for changes 
  to happen. Some may consider doubling or tripling their dose, thinking that 
  the more they put in, the faster the changes will come. However, as was mentioned 
  in the &quot;<a href="ttherapybasics.html">FTM Testosterone Therapy Basics</a>&quot; 
  section, dramatically increasing your dose might have the effect of <i>slowing</i> 
  your changes. This is because excess testosterone in your body can be converted 
  into estrogen by an enzyme called &quot;aromatase.&quot; This conversion is 
  part of the body's natural feedback system-- if there is an abundance of testosterone 
  in the body, it is converted (&quot;aromatized&quot;) to estrogen in order to 
  maintain a &quot;normal&quot; hormonal balance. Therefore, taking very large 
  doses of testosterone might not be a great idea. Be patient; if you are not 
  seeing results in a reasonable period of time, and/or your T levels are low, 
  discuss modifying your dosage with your doctor.</p>

  therapy, please see the &quot;<a href="tandhealth.html">FTM Testosterone

<p><a name="esters"></a><b>Testosterone esters: what they are and how they work</b><br>
  Much of the testosterone that is prescribed for the purposes of hormone therapy 
  is in the form of testosterone &quot;esters.&quot; An ester is simply a name for a chemical 
  compound that is formed from reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. 
  A simple chemical diagram of this reaction is shown below in Figure A. Figure 
  B shows the chemical structure of free testosterone (chemical formula C<SUB>19</SUB>H<SUB>28</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>) as well as two different 
  esters of testosterone (testosterone cypionate and testosterone enanthate).</p>
<p><img src="images/esterformation.gif" alt="chemical reaction forming an ester" width="600" height="155" align="bottom"></p>
<p><img src="images/Tand2esters.gif" alt="testosterone molecule and testosterone ester molecules" width="600" height="187" align="top"></p>
<p>There are a number of different esters of testosterone, including the commonly 
  prescribed injectables of testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate, 
  as well others such as acetate, propionate, phenylpropionate, isocaproate, 
  caproate, decanoate, and undecanoate. Each of these different esters is a molecular chain 
  composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The main difference between the different esters
  is how many carbon and hydrogen atoms make up the chain. For example, the propionate 
  ester is composed of 3 carbons, 6 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens, whereas the cypionate 
  ester is composed of 8 carbons, 14 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.</p>
<p>Esterification of testosterone is done in order to improve the solubility of 
  testosterone in oil, which in turn slows the release of the testosterone from 
  the site where it enters the body.</p>
<p>Testosterone, in its free, non-esterified form, has poor solubility in either 
  oil or water-- though it can be suspended in water. Non-esterified testosterone 
  is available in an aqueous injectable form with the drug name &quot;Aquaviron.&quot; 
  However, this form of testosterone stays active in the body for a very 
  short period of time (only a matter of hours). 
  Because of this, it must be injected on a daily basis in order to maintain a 
  continuous level of testosterone in the blood. Therefore it is rarely used for 
  testosterone replacement therapy as an injectable.</p>
<p>Once you have added an ester group to testosterone, it becomes even less soluble 
  in water and more soluble in oil. Additionally, as a general rule, the more 
  carbon atoms there are in an ester, the more soluble the ester is in oil. For 
  example, testosterone propionate (with 3 carbon atoms in the ester group) is 
  less soluble in oil than testosterone cypionate (with 8 carbon atoms in the 
  ester group). Remember, this is general, simplified rule; the solubility of a molecule depends on structural factors that are beyond the scope of this section.</p>
<p>So generally, the more carbons the ester group has, the more soluble in oil it becomes, 
  and the less soluble in water. The term for this ratio between oil and water 
  solubility is called the &quot;partition coefficient&quot;-- the higher the 
  solubility in oil, the higher the partition coefficient.</p>
<p>The partition coefficient of the ester in question is important because it 
  effects how long the drug itself stays in the system. If the testosterone transfers 
  too quickly from the oil to the blood, the result is a sudden spike in testosterone 
  which then rapidly drops once the dose has been used up. In the example of free testosterone injected into 
  the body from a water suspension (as in Aquiviron, mentioned above), the testosterone 
  is essentially immediately available to the bloodstream due to its low partition 
  coefficient, and thus there is an immediate spike of testosterone which is used 
  up quickly in the body.</p>
<p>Testosterone cypionate, on the other hand, has a high partition coefficient. 
  When injected into the body, the drug remains in its esterified form in a 
  deposit in the muscle tissue or fat tissue, depending on the type of injection. From there, it will slowly enter the circulation 
  as it is picked up in small quantities by the blood. Once the esterified testosterone 
  is brought into the blood stream, &quot;esterase enzymes&quot; cleave off the 
  ester chain in a process known as &quot;hydrolization,&quot; thus leaving the 
  testosterone in its free form to perform its various actions and effects.</p>
<p>When people speak of whether a particular testosterone 
  ester is &quot;fast acting&quot; or &quot;slow acting,&quot; they are usually referring to the partition coefficient/solubility in oil. As 
  described above, esters with more carbon atoms will generally be more soluble in oil-- they are often referred to as &quot;slow-acting&quot; 
  esters (they stay active in the system longer). Esters that are less soluble in oil are often referred to as &quot;fast-acting&quot; 
  forms of testosterone, referring to the fact that they are more quickly available 
  and used up in the blood stream.</p>
<p>For trans men who are using injectable testosterone, slow-acting esters tend to be preferred, as fewer injections are needed over time to 
  keep the blood levels of T reasonably constant. Testosterone enanthate (7 carbons) 
  and testosterone cypionate (8 carbons) both take about 8-10 days to be fully released in the system, 
  and so they are typically injected once every 7-14 days. Testosterone propionate 
  (3 carbons) takes about 3-4 days to be fully released in the system, and must be injected in smaller doses at least 
  weekly if not twice weekly. For this reason it is not often prescribed for men 
  in transition.</p>

<h2><a name="tdelivery"></a>Testosterone delivery methods </h2>
<p><a name="injectables"></a><b>Injectable testosterone <br>
  </b>The dosage amount and timing for injectable testosterone will depend largely 
  upon which ester is being used, as well as the individual's own response to 
  the hormone. In general, dosages will vary between 50 mg and 300 mg per injection, 
  depending on the ester and the dosing regimen. An average injectable dose is 
  about 200-250 mg every two weeks, though many trans men inject 100 mg every week or every 10 days, 
  or other variations depending on their own bodies' needs and sensitivities. 
  Again, the exact dosage required will vary from person to person, and health 
  and well-being should be carefully monitored while determining an individual's 
  ideal dose.</p>
<p>Some doctors recommend decreasing the dosage of injectables to 100-150 mg every 
  two weeks for those trans men whose ovaries are inactive, or who have had their ovaries 
  removed. Again, this will vary from person to person.</p>
<p>There are a number of different types of injectable testosterone; those available 
  may differ depending on the country in which you reside. The drug names for 
  the same ester of testosterone may also differ depending on the company who 
  produces it. This is not an exhaustive list, though it does cover the main injectable 
  forms of T which are used by trans men for testosterone therapy.</p>
<p>Finally, testosterone esters are typically suspended in either cottonseed oil 
  or sesame seed oil. Some people find that they may have an allergic or skin reaction 
  to one of the oils. Certain brand-name testosterone esters 
  are mass produced using one oil or the other (as noted below), but by using 
  a compounding pharmacy, you can have any testosterone ester suspended in your 
  choice of oil (with a proper prescription). (<a href="compounding.html">For

<p><b>Injectable esters commonly used by trans men for testosterone therapy:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><a name="enanthate"></a>Testosterone enanthate: </b>Chemical formula C<SUB>26</SUB>H<SUB>40</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB><br>
    Testosterone enanthate is one of the main forms of testosterone prescribed 
    to trans men in the United States. It is a slow-acting ester with a release time 
    between 8-10 days. The name-brand of T-enanthate available in the United 
    States is called &quot;Delatestryl,&quot; which is suspended in sesame oil. 
    Testosterone enanthate is typically injected anywhere between once every week 
    to once every three weeks. Generic testosterone enanthate can also be obtained 
    through a compounding pharmacy; such pharmacies can mix T-enanthate in sesame, cotton seed, or any other appropriate oil. (<a href="compounding.html">For more information 
    about compounding pharmacies, click here</a>.)</p>
  <p><b><a name="cypionate"></a>Testosterone cypionate: </b>Chemical formula C<SUB>27</SUB>H<SUB>40</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB><br>
    Testosterone cypionate is the other main injectable form of testosterone prescribed 
    to trans men in the United States. It is a slow-acting ester with a release time 
    between 8-10 days, similar to that of enanthate. The name-brand of T-cypionate 
    available in the United States is called &quot;Depo-Testosterone,&quot; which 
    is suspended in cottonseed oil. Testosterone cypionate is typically injected 
    anywhere between once every week to once every three weeks. Generic testosterone 
    cypionate can also be obtained through a compounding pharmacy; such pharmacies 
    can mix T-cypionate in sesame, cotton seed, or any other appropriate oil.<b> </b>(<a href="compounding.html">For 
    more information about compounding pharmacies, click here.</a>)</p>
  <p><b><a name="sustanon"></a>Sustanon <br>
    </b> &quot;Sustanon&quot; is the brand name for two formulas of injectable testosterone that contain  a blend of 
    esters. &quot;Sustanon 100&quot; contains three testosterone esters: testosterone propionate (C<SUB>22</SUB>H<SUB>32</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), testosterone phenylpropionate (C<SUB>28</SUB>H<SUB>36</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), and 
    testosterone isocaproate (C<SUB>25</SUB>H<SUB>38</SUB>0<SUB>3</SUB>). 
    &quot;Sustanon 250&quot; contains four testosterone esters: testosterone propionate (C<SUB>22</SUB>H<SUB>32</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), testosterone phenylpropionate (C<SUB>28</SUB>H<SUB>36</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), testosterone isocaproate (C<SUB>25</SUB>H<SUB>38</SUB>0<SUB>3</SUB>), and testosterone decanoate (C<SUB>29</SUB>H<SUB>46</SUB>0<SUB>3</SUB>). Both formulas feature fast-acting and slow-acting esters, and can be injected anywhere 
    from once every week to once every four weeks. Sustanon is prescribed outside of 
    the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Other injectable esters of testosterone:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><a name="propionate"></a>Testosterone propionate:</b> Chemical formula 
    C<SUB>22</SUB>H<SUB>32</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB><br>
    Testosterone propionate is a fast-acting ester with a release time of 3-4 
    days. To keep blood levels from fluctuating greatly, propionate is usually 
    injected between one to three times a week. It is for this reason that it 
    is not usually prescribed for FTM hormone therapy. Some users also report 
    that propionate is a more painful injection, with swelling and noticeable 
    pain around the injection site. Brand names of testosterone propionate include 
    &quot;Testovis&quot; and &quot;Virormone.&quot;</p>
  <p><b><a name="phenylpropionate"></a>Testosterone phenylpropionate:</b> Chemical 
    formula C<SUB>28</SUB>H<SUB>36</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB><br>
    Testosterone phenylpropionate is a slow-acting ester, with a release time 
    of 1-3 weeks. A popular name brand for T-phenylpropionate is &quot;Testolent.&quot; 
    Testosterone phenylpropionate is also one of the components of Sustanon and 
    Omnadren.</p>
  <p><b><a name="omnadren"></a>Omnadren</b><br>
    &quot;Omnadren&quot; is the brand name for a blend of four testosterone esters: 
    testosterone propionate (C<SUB>22</SUB>H<SUB>32</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), testosterone phenylpropionate (C<SUB>28</SUB>H<SUB>36</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), 
    testosterone isocaproate (C<SUB>25</SUB>H<SUB>38</SUB>0<SUB>3</SUB>), and testosterone decanoate (C<SUB>29</SUB>H<SUB>46</SUB>0<SUB>3</SUB>). 
    In the past, Omnadren consisted of a blend of different esters, but now is 
    essentially the same formula as Sustanon, mentioned above. It features both 
    fast-acting and slow-acting esters, and can be injected anywhere from once 
    every week to once every four weeks. It is sometimes prescribed in parts of 
    Europe.</p>
  <p><b><a name="aqueous"></a>Aqueous testosterone suspension<br>
    </b> In the United States, injectable aqueous (non-esterified) testosterone 
    is available, but it is very short-acting (it is completely released in the 
    system within a matter of hours). Therefore, it is not typically used for 
    men in transition, as it would require constant re-injection to maintain 
    regular blood levels. The brand name for aqueous testosterone suspension is 
    &quot;Aquaviron.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="transdermal"></a>Transdermal testosterone</b><br>
  The term &quot;transdermal&quot; refers to topical delivery through 
  the skin, by the use of a patch, gel, or cream.</p>
<p>Transdermal testosterone is usually applied to the skin daily in small doses 
  in an effort to keep a steady level of testosterone in the system at all times. 
  This approach avoids the &quot;peaks and valleys&quot; in T-levels sometimes 
  associated with injectable testosterone. With injectables, T levels can reach 
  a low-point a few days before the next shot is due, which can cause irritability, 
  hot flashes, and low energy in some users. Daily transdermal application can 
  help alleviate such problems. Indeed, some trans men who regularly use injectable 
  testosterone sometimes supplement with a gel or patch during the last few days 
  of their dosing cycle to maintain their T levels.</p>
<p>Transdermal application is also attractive to those individuals who are not 
  comfortable with needles and injections.</p>
<p>However, there are some disadvantages to transdermal delivery. Some forms of 
  daily transdermal testosterone application, particularly the patch, are substantially 
  more expensive than injectable testosterone. Testosterone patches often cause 
  skin irritation and/or allergic reactions to users. They can fall off with excessive 
  sweating, and they must be fully protected with plastic when swimming. Testosterone 
  cream and gel can be transferred by direct skin contact with a partner; special 
  care must be taken with female partners who wish to avoid potential virilization.</p>
<p><b><a name="patch"></a>Testosterone patches<br>
  </b>There are currently two brand-name testosterone patches available in the 
  United States: &quot;Androderm&quot; and &quot;Testoderm.&quot; (Note that there 
  are two forms of Testoderm available: a scrotal patch and a non-scrotal patch. 
  The non-scrotal patch, &quot;Testoderm TTS,&quot; is described herein). Generic 
  testosterone patches are not yet available. Both Androderm and Testoderm TTS 
  are very fast-acting once they have permeated the skin. The testosterone in 
  the patches is suspended in an alcohol-based gel.</p>
<p>In order to deliver testosterone efficiently into the body, chemical enhancers 
  are added to the patch to increase permeability of the skin. It is these enhancers 
  that are often the cause of skin irritation in many users. Some individuals 
  find Testoderm TTS to be less irritating to the skin than Androderm, but this 
  will vary from person to person.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Androderm<br>
    </b> Androderm patches come in two doses: 2.5 mg/patch and 5.0 mg/patch. The 
    actual amount of testosterone in the 2.5 mg patch is 12.2 mg, and the actual 
    amount in the 5.0 mg patch is 24.3 mg. The reason is that much of the testosterone 
    in the patch will not manage to get into the system. So, for example, the 
    aim of the 2.5 mg patch is to get about 2.5 mg successfully into the bloodstream 
    per day. Therefore, it is possible to absorb slightly more or slightly less 
    than the 2.5 mg of the patch's ideal dosage (the same reasoning, of course, 
    applies to the 5.0 mg patch as well).</p>
  <p>Androderm patches are usually applied on the back, abdomen, thighs, or upper 
    arms. Because the active area of the patch is covered, the wearer does not 
    have to worry about skin contact with a partner. Dosages will vary between 
    2.5 mg - 10 mg daily, by applying a single patch or combination of patches. 
    As with any form of testosterone, dosage should be determined by your overall 
    health, your testosterone levels as checked by your doctor, and your progress 
    in masculinization.</p>
  <p><b>Testoderm TTS<br>
    </b> There are two types of Testoderm patches: one is intended for scrotal 
    application, and one for application on other areas of the body. Testoderm 
    TTS refers to the non-scrotal version of the patch-- this is the patch that 
    should be used by trans men.</p>
  <p> Testoderm TTS patches come in two doses: 4.0 mg/patch and 6.0 mg/patch. 
    As with Androderm, the actual amount of testosterone in these patches is greater 
    than the listed dose. The reason is the same as explained above in the Androderm 
    section. </p>
  <p>Testoderm TTS patches are usually applied on the back, abdomen, thighs, or 
    upper arms. Because the active area of the patch is covered, the wearer does 
    not have to worry about skin contact with a partner. Dosages will vary between 
    4.0 mg - 10 mg daily, by applying a single patch or combination of patches. 
    As with any form of testosterone, dosage should be determined by your overall 
    health, your testosterone levels as checked by your doctor, and your progress 
    in masculinization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="gelcream"></a>Testosterone gels, creams, and other topical applications</b><br>
  There are currently two brand-name versions of testosterone gel available in 
  the United States: Androgel and Testim. A brand-name under-arm application of testosterone called Axiron is also available in the U.S. There are no brand-name testosterone 
  creams at this time. Both cream and gel formulations of testosterone can be 
  made by compounding pharmacies. (<a href="compounding.html">For more information 
  about compounding pharmacies, click here</a>.) Gel formulations of testosterone 
  are typically alcohol-based, whereas creams are typically safflower oil-based. 
  The testosterone in creams and gels is typically very fast-acting once absorbed 
  through the skin. Thus, it must be applied once or twice daily to maintain 
T levels.</p>
<p>Creams and gels are applied directly onto the skin. Care must be taken to avoid 
  skin-to-skin contact with a partner on the site of application. Transfer of 
  the testosterone from the site can be prevented by keeping the area covered.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Androgel<br>
    </b> Androgel is a clear, alcohol-based gel that contains 1% non-esterified 
    testosterone. It is very fast-acting once it has been absorbed by the skin, 
    and so must be applied 1-2 times daily to maintain T levels. It is available 
    in either unit-dose packets or multiple-dose pumps. The unit dose packets 
    contain either 25 mg or 50 mg of testosterone. Approximately 10% of the applied 
    testosterone from the packets is absorbed into the system, resulting in an 
    effective dose of 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg, respectively.</p>
  <p>Androgel should be applied to clean, dry skin and should not be applied to 
    the genital area. Application sites should be allowed to dry for a few minutes 
    prior to dressing. Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water after 
    application. </p>
  <p>In order to prevent transfer to another person, clothing should be worn to 
    cover the application sites. If direct skin-to-skin contact with another person 
    is anticipated, the application sites should be washed thoroughly with soap 
    and water. Users should wait at least 2 hours after applying before showering 
    or swimming; for optimal absorption, it may be best to wait 5-6 hours.</p>
  <p><b>Testim<br>
    </b> Testim, like Androgel, is a clear, alcohol-based gel that contains 1% 
    non-esterified testosterone. It is very fast-acting once it has been absorbed 
    by the skin, and so must be applied 1-2 times daily to maintain T levels. 
    It is available in 5.0g unit-dose tubes. A 5.0g unit dose tube contains 50 
    mg of testosterone. Approximately 10% of the applied testosterone from the 
    tube is absorbed into the system, resulting in an effective dose of 5.0 mg. 
  </p>
  <p>Testim should be applied to clean, dry skin-- preferably to the shoulders 
    and/or upper arms. It should not be applied to the genitals or to the abdomen. 
    Application sites should be allowed to dry for a few minutes prior to dressing. 
    Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water after application. </p>
  <p>In order to prevent transfer to another person, clothing should be worn to 
    cover the application sites. If direct skin-to-skin contact with another person 
    is anticipated, the application sites should be washed thoroughly with soap 
    and water. Users should wait at least 2 hours after applying before showering 
    or swimming; for optimal absorption, it may be best to wait 5-6 hours.</p>
  <p><strong>Axiron</strong><br>
    Axiron is an alcohol-based solution that delivers 30 mg of testosterone per 1.5 mL solution,  available via a metered-dose pump. Each pump actuation delivers 30 mg of testosterone, which is applied to the armpit(s) with the supplied applicator. It is typically applied once daily as directed to maintain T levels; dosage may vary from one pump (30mg) to up to four pump doses (120mg) per day as directed by your doctor.</p>
  <p>Axiron should be applied to clean, unbroken skin in the armpits-- there is no need to shave the armpit before application. It should not be applied to the genitals, the abdomen, or any other application site. 
    Armpits should be allowed to dry for a few minutes prior to dressing. 
  Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water after application. If an individual is using deodorant or anti-perspirant, these should be applied to the armpit a few minutes before applying Axiron.</p>
  <p>In order to prevent transfer to another person, clothing should be worn to 
    cover the application sites. If direct skin-to-skin contact with another person 
    is anticipated, the application sites should be washed thoroughly with soap 
    and water. Users should wait at least 2 hours after applying before showering 
    or swimming; for optimal absorption, it may be best to wait 5-6 hours.</p>
  <p><b>Compounded creams and gels<br>
    </b> Compounded creams and gels can be mixed by compounding pharmacies, and 
    are similar in dosing, application, and precautions to what is described above 
    for Androgel and Testim.</p>
  <p>There are two advantages of using compounding pharmacies for testosterone 
    gel or cream. The first is cost: until a generic version of the gel is available, 
    compounded gel will usually be the cheaper alternative. The second is customization: 
    your doctor can write a prescription of varying concentration for gels or 
    creams. (<a href="compounding.html">For more information about compounding

<p><b><a name="oral"></a>Oral testosterone <br>
  </b>Chemically unbound testosterone, if taken orally, is not effective for masculinization 
  since it is immediately deactivated by the liver. However, two chemically-modified 
  forms of testosterone have been successfully shown to induce masculine secondary 
  sex characteristics when taken orally: methyltestosterone and testosterone undecanoate. 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Methyltestosterone (C-17 alpha methylated testosterone)</b><br>
    Methyltestosterone is one of the earliest available oral testosterones. Its 
    chemical structure is the hormone testosterone with an added methyl group 
    at the c-17 alpha position of the molecule. The use of oral c-17 alpha methylated 
    testosterone for masculinization is obsolete due to its toxicity to the liver. 
    As such, <b>methyltestosterone is not recommended for FTM hormone therapy</b>. 
    Brand names include &quot;Metesto,&quot; &quot;Methitest,&quot; &quot;Testred,&quot; 
    &quot;Oreton Methyl,&quot; and &quot;Android.&quot;</p>
  <p><b>Testosterone undecanoate</b><br>
    Testosterone undecanoate is not a c-17 alpha alkylated hormone. Therefore, 
    it is considered a safer oral form of testosterone. It is designed to be absorbed 
    through the small intestine into the lymphatic system, posing less burden 
    on the liver. Brand names for testosterone undecanoate include &quot;Andriol,&quot; 
    &quot;Androxon,&quot; &quot;Understor,&quot; &quot;Restandol,&quot; and &quot;Restinsol.&quot; 
    It is not available in the United States.</p>
  <p>One disadvantage of orally administered undecanoate is that it is eliminated 
    from the body very quickly, usually in 3-4 hours. Thus, frequent administration 
    is necessary-- usually between 3-6 capsules a day. This can prove to be expensive when compared to injectable testosterone.</p>
  <p>Finally, when used in FTM hormone therapy, it has been reported that oral testosterone undecanoate has not 
    always been successful in suppression of menstruation.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="sublingual"></a>Sublingual/buccal testosterone <br>
  </b>Sublingual and buccal testosterone delivery works by either placing a dissolving 
  tablet under your tongue (sublingual) or by placing a tablet against the surface 
  of the gums (buccal). It is different from oral delivery in that very little 
  of the substance is swallowed, avoiding potential liver toxicity.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Sublingual<br>
    </b> Sublingual testosterone can be obtained through compounding pharmacies. 
    (<a href="compounding.html">For more information about compounding pharmacies, 
    click here</a>.) </p>
  <p><b>Buccal<br>
    </b> In 2003, the FDA approved a sustained-release buccal testosterone tablet 
    called &quot;Striant.&quot; It acts by adhering to the buccal mucosa (the 
    small depression in the mouth where the gum meets the upper lip above the 
    incisor teeth). Once applied, the tablet softens and delivers testosterone 
    through the buccal mucosa, where it is then absorbed directly into the bloodstream, 
    bypassing the gastrointestinal system and liver.</p>
  <p> The recommended dosage for Striant is to replace the tablet about every 
    12 hours, though a different dosing schedule or number of tablets might be 
    required depending on the needs of the patient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="pellet"></a>Subcutaneous testosterone pellet <br>
  </b> Another relatively new form of testosterone delivery is via a pellet of 
  pure, crystalline testosterone implanted beneath the skin. The pellets are about 
  the size of a grain of rice, and are typically placed in the buttocks or abdomen. 
  The insertion of the pellets is a quick procedure, usually done under local 
  anesthesia. Pellets are typically replaced after 3-4 months. &quot;Testopel&quot; 
  is a brand name for testosterone pellets in the United States.</p>
<p>A 200 mg testosterone pellet releases testosterone at a steady rate of 1-3 
  mg per day. Several pellets can be inserted at the same time to increase dosage.</p>
<p>Some users have reported problems with the pellets working their way out from 
  under the skin.</p>
