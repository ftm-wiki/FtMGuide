<P><strong>Associates/Affiliate Links</strong><br>
  The web site participates in a few affiliate/associate programs-- this means a small percentage of sales generated by clicking from this site to certain online sellers are paid to the author to support Hudson's FTM Resource Guide. All proceeds generated from sales via associates/affiliates programs are used toward web hosting fees and site upkeep and maintenance.</P>
<P>Bear in mind that this site was created long before affiliate programs were even a twinkle in bloggers' eyes. I had already been linking to many different online stores( with no monetary gain on my part) because they offered the products trans guys were looking for. The vast majority of the links I have on my site are not affiliate or advertising links, and generate no income for me whatsoever... which is fine, because I didn't create this site to make money. I built it to share information that I find valuable. If you happen to click on something that supports the site, that's great. If not, that's great, too.</P>
<P><strong>PRIVACY</strong><br>
Hudson's FTM Resource Guide  does not collect or share personal information from users of this site. The only exception to this general rule is in the case of harassing or otherwise threatening emails or contacts, which will be reported to proper authorities. </P>
