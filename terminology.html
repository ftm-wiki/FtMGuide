<H1><a name="top"></a>FTM Basics: Terminology</H1>
<P>This page contains definitions of a number of terms that are commonly used 
within FTM and transgender communities. These definitions are not meant to be 
the "last word" on any particular term or subject; rather, they are meant to 
help orient those who may be new to FTM issues. Please think of this page as one 
possible starting point toward knowledge and understanding of trans men's 
issues. Remember that each of us is different, and the best way to learn is to 
be inquisitive, respectful, and to keep an open mind.</P>
<P><B>bilateral mastectomy</B>: see "double incision" </P>
<P><B>binding</B>: The process of flattening one's breast tissue in order to 
create a male-appearing chest. The type of materials and methods used for 
binding will vary depending on the size of an individual's chest and the overall 
build of his body. Some trans men don't bind at all due to personal preference, comfort issues, or because 
they may have small chests. Some use different methods of layering clothing to 
help hide their chests. Some bind only on certain occasions; some bind all the 
time. <A href="binding.html">To learn more about binding methods and 
store-bought binding products, click here</A>.</P>
<P><B>bottom surgery</B>: see "genital reconstruction surgery"</P>
<P><B>chest surgery, </B><B>chest reconstruction surgery</B>: Sometimes also 
referred to as "top surgery." Chest surgery is the most common surgical 
procedure sought by trans men. The goal of chest surgery is to create a contoured, 
male-looking chest. There are two basic procedures that are usually performed to 
accomplish this goal: 1. Double incision/Bilateral mastectomy, or 2. 
Keyhole/Peri-areolar incision (see individual entries for more detail).</P>
<P>There are a few other surgical variations used for chest reconstruction, 
including the "inverted T" incision, the "pie wedge" method, and other 
combinations of incisions that a surgeon may see as the best approach for the 
patient. <A href="chest.html">To learn more about chest surgery procedures, 
click here</A>.</P>
<P><B>cypionate</B>: Short for testosterone cypionate. (Chemical Formula 
C<SUB>27</SUB>H<SUB>40</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>) Testosterone cypionate is one of the main injectable forms of 
testosterone prescribed to trans men in the United States. It is a slow-acting ester 
with a release time between 10 to 14 days. The name-brand of T-cypionate available 
in the United States is called "Depo-Testosterone," which is suspended in 
cottonseed oil. Testosterone cypionate is typically injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly 
anywhere between once every week to once every three weeks. <A 
href="ttypes.html">To learn more about cypionate, esters, and other types of 
testosterone, click here</A>. See also "testosterone."</P>
<P><B>double incision</B>: Also called "bilateral mastectomy." A type of chest 
surgery procedure that is effective for individuals with a medium to large 
amount of breast tissue. In this method, large incisions are made horizontally 
across each breast, usually below the nipple. The skin is then peeled back so 
that the mammary glands and fatty tissue can be removed with a scalpel. The 
muscles of the chest are not touched. Certain areas of harder-to-reach fatty 
tissue may also be removed via liposuction (such as areas near the armpits). 
Once the extraneous tissue has been removed, the excess chest skin is trimmed 
and the incisions closed, leaving two seams/scars just below the line of the 
pectoral muscles. Nipples are usually resized and grafted into place. <A 
href="chest.html">To learn more about chest surgery options, click here</A>. See 
also "chest surgery."</P>
<P><B>enanthate</B>: Short for testosterone enanthate. (Chemical Formula 
C<SUB>26</SUB>H<SUB>40</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>) Testosterone enanthate is one of the main forms of testosterone 
prescribed to trans men in the United States. It is a slow-acting ester with a 
release time between 10 to 14 days. The name-brand of T-enanthate available in the 
United States is called "Delatestryl," which is suspended in sesame oil. 
Testosterone enanthate is typically injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly anywhere between 
once every week to once every three weeks. <A href="ttypes.html">To learn more 
about enanthate, esters, and different types of prescribed testosterone, click 
here</A>. See also "testosterone."</P>
<P><B>ester</B>: A name for a chemical compound that is formed from reaction 
between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Much of the testosterone that is 
prescribed for the purposes of hormone therapy is in the form of esters. The 
most commonly prescribed testosterone esters in the United States for FTM 
hormone therapy are testosterone cypionate and testosterone enanthate. <A 
href="ttypes.html">To learn more about esters, and other types of testosterone, 
click here</A>. See also "cypionate" and "enanthate." <A 
href="ttypes.html"></A></P>
<P><B>F2M</B>: see "FTM"</P>
<P><B>female-to-male transsexual</B>: A person 
who was born in a female body but whose gender identity is male. Also can refer 
to those assigned female at birth, in the case of intersex people, whose 
gender identity is male. Often, female-to-male transsexuals will seek hormonal 
and/or surgical treatment in order to live as a men in society. NOTE: The use of the term &quot;transsexual&quot; has fallen out of favor in recent years due to its strong links to the medicalization of trans identities. That said, there are still a percentage of trans people who prefer to identify with the term transsexual.</P>
<P><B>FTM</B>: Short for Female-To-Male. Usually said aloud as "F to M." The term originally was used to refer specifically to female-to-male transsexuals (and the female-to-male transition process), though in recent years it has come to be used by others 
who are born in female bodies and who move toward masculine or male presentation 
without hormones or surgery. See also "female-to-male transsexual" and &quot;transition.&quot;</P>
<P><strong>gender confirmation surgery (GCS):</strong> Considered by some to be an affirming and positive term for the various surgical procedures included under the broad category of &quot;sex reassignment surgery (SRS).&quot; See also &quot;sex reassignment surgery (SRS),&quot; "chest surgery," "genital reconstruction surgery (GRS)," "hysterectomy," and "oophorectomy."</P>
<P><B>gender dysphoria</B>: Also body dysphoria. A term coined by psychologists and medical doctors that refers to the state of discomfort felt by 
  some trans people caused by the incongruity between one's 
  physical sex and one's gender identity.</P>
<P><B>gender identity</B>: A person's internal self-awareness of being either 
male or female, masculine or feminine, or something in-between.</P>
<P><B>Gender Identity Disorder (GID)</B>: A condition identified by 
psychologists and medical doctors wherein a person who has been identified as/assigned a specific
gender at birth identifies as belonging to another gender.</P>
<P><B>genderqueer</B>: A person whose gender identity is neither 
male nor female, is between or beyond genders, or is some combination of 
genders.</P>
<P><B>genital reconstruction surgery (GRS)</B>: Sometimes also referred to as 
"genital reassignment surgery," &quot;bottom surgery,&quot; or &quot;lower surgery.&quot; For trans men, this is the process of constructing a 
phallus/penis from an individual's own donor tissue (this is usually referred to 
as "phalloplasty"), or the process of "freeing up" the enlarged clitoris from 
its connective tissue (the clitoris is typically elongated and changed somewhat 
in appearance as a result of testosterone therapy) so that it is presented on the body in 
a more phallic/penis-like manner (this is usually referred to as 
"metoidioplasty"). Scrotal implants may or may not be added during these 
procedures. <A href="grs.html">To learn more about genital reconstruction 
surgery, click here</A>. See also "phalloplasty" and "metoidioplasty."</P>
<P><B>GID</B>: see "Gender Identity Disorder"</P>
<P><B>GRS</B>: see "genital reconstruction surgery"</P>
<P><B>Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA):</B> see &quot;World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)&quot;</P>
<P><B>Harry Benjamin Standards of Care (HBSOC)</B>: see &quot;World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care&quot;</P>
<P><B>HBIGDA</B>: short for "Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria 
Association;" see &quot;World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)&quot;</P>
<P><B>HBSOC:</B> short for "Harry Benjamin Standards of Care;" see &quot;World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care&quot;</P>
<P><B>hermaphrodite</B>: considered by many to be an outdated and pejorative term; see "intersex"</P>
<P><B>hysterectomy</B>: Sometimes shortened to "hysto." The surgical removal of 
the uterus. This surgery is sometimes pursued by trans men as part of the transition 
process, as well as for health reasons. A hysterectomy is required by some 
states in order to legally change one's gender status from female to male. <A 
href="hysto.html">To learn more about the hysterectomy procedure, click 
here</A>. See also "oophorectomy."</P>
<P><B>hysto</B>: see "hysterectomy"</P>
<P><B>intersex</B>: The condition of being born with genitalia or reproductive anatomy that is difficult 
to label as male or female, and/or developing secondary sexual characteristics 
of indeterminate sex or which combine features of both sexes. The term 
"hermaphrodite" had been used in the past to refer to intersex persons, but 
that term is now considered by many to be negative and inaccurate. (For an in-depth discussion of intersex conditions, please visit the Intersex Society of North America's web site: <a href="http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex">www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex</a>.)</P>
<P>Many intersex infants and children are subjected to genital 
surgeries and hormone treatments in order to conform their bodies to the 
standard of either "male" or "female." There is a growing movement to prevent 
such surgeries in children to allow freedom of choice for intersex people regarding their bodies. </P>
<P><B>keyhole</B>: A type of chest surgery procedure that is effective for 
individuals with small amounts of breast tissue. In the keyhole method, a small 
incision is made along the border of the areola (usually along the bottom), and 
the breast tissue is removed via a liposuction needle through the incision. The 
nipple is left attached to the body via a pedicle (a stalk of tissue) in an attempt
to maintain sensation. Once the breast tissue has been removed, the incision is 
closed. The nipple is usually not resized or repositioned. <A 
href="chest.html">To learn more about chest surgery options, click here</A>. See 
also "chest surgery."</P>
<P><strong>low ho or lo-ho:</strong> A term that refers to taking relatively low doses of testosterone. </P>
<P><B>lower surgery</B>: see "genital reconstruction surgery"</P>
<P><B>meta</B>: see "metoidioplasty"</P>
<P><B>metaoidioplasty</B>: alternate spelling for "metoidioplasty"</P>
<P><B>metoidioplasty</B>: Sometimes spelled "metaoidioplasty;" sometimes 
shortened to "meta." The surgical process of "freeing up" the enlarged clitoris 
from its connective tissue (the clitoris is typically elongated and changed 
somewhat in appearance as a result of testosterone therapy) so that it is presented on the 
body in a more phallic or penis-like manner. Scrotal implants may or may not be 
added. <A href="grs.html"></A><A href="grs.html">To learn more about 
metoidioplasty and other kinds of genital reconstruction surgery, click 
here</A>. See also "genital reconstruction surgery."</P>
<P><strong>non-binary:</strong> A person whose gender identity is neither 
male nor female, is between or beyond genders, or is some combination or is some combination of 
genders.</P>
<P><B>oophorectomy</B>: The surgical removal of one or both ovaries. This 
surgery is often pursued by trans men, usually in combination with a hysterectomy, as 
part of the transition process, as well as for health reasons. A hysterectomy is 
required by some states in order to legally change one's gender status from 
female to male. <A href="hysto.html">To learn more about the oophorectomy 
procedure, click here</A>. See also "hysterectomy."</P>
<P><B>packer</B>: see "packing"</P>
<P><B>packing</B>: The process of creating a male-looking and/or male-feeling bulge in one's crotch. 
This can be accomplished through a home-made or store-bought pants stuffer, or 
through a realistic-looking prosthetic device. A packing device may be referred 
to as a "packer" or "packy," or as an "STP packer" if it can also be used to pee 
through while standing up (STP= Stand To Pee). Some guys simply refer to their 
packer or prosthetic as a cock and balls, a dick, etc.</P>
<P>Some trans men do not pack at all-- some find it too hot and/or sticky, others 
find it uncomfortable and/or inconvenient, and still others find it personally 
unnecessary. Some trans men pack simply for the sake of creating a realistic-looking 
bulge in their pants. Others may pack only on certain occasions (while swimming, 
while in the locker room, or wearing tight-fitting pants). Still others may feel 
incomplete and/or conspicuous without wearing a packer or prosthetic device. 
Some have realistic prosthetics that are affixed to the skin for wear throughout 
the day and night. For some trans men, the term "packing" itself is not even an 
accurate descriptor for the wearing of a prosthetic device-- a prosthetic may be 
considered more an extension of the body rather than merely a pants-stuffer. <A 
href="packing.html">To learn more about packing and packing devices and 
prosthetics, click here</A>.</P>
<P><B>passing</B>: In an FTM context, being seen or read as male by others 
(e.g., "On the street, Alex was passing as a man"). Many trans people
object to the term "passing," as it implies that one is being mistaken for 
something they are not, or engaging in deception.</P>
<P><B>patch, the, or T patch</B>: Refers to testosterone as applied via a patch 
adhered daily to the skin. <B></B>There are currently two brand-name 
testosterone patches available in the United States: "Androderm" and 
"Testoderm." The testosterone in these patches is suspended in an alcohol-based 
gel. In order to deliver the testosterone efficiently into the body, chemical 
enhancers are added to the patch to increase permeability of the skin. <A 
href="ttypes.html">To learn more about testosterone patches and other forms of 
testosterone, click here.</A> See also "testosterone."</P>
<P><B>peri</B>: see "peri-areolar"</P>
<P><B>peri-areolar</B>: Sometimes shortened to "peri." A type of chest surgery 
procedure that is effective for individuals with small to medium amounts of 
breast tissue. In the peri-areolar method, an incision is made along the entire 
circumference of the areola. The nipple is usually left attached to the body via 
a pedicle in an attempt to maintain sensation. Breast tissue is then "scooped out" by 
scalpel, or with a combination of scalpel and liposuction. The areola may be 
trimmed somewhat to reduce its size. Excess skin on the chest may also be 
trimmed away along the circumference of the incision. The skin is then pulled 
taut toward the center of the opening and the nipple is reattached to cover the 
opening-- much like pulling a drawstring bag closed. Thus, this procedure is 
also sometimes referred to as the drawstring or "purse string" technique. The 
nipple/areola may be repositioned slightly, depending on original chest size and 
the available skin. <A href="chest.html">To learn more about chest surgery 
options, click here</A>. See also "chest surgery."</P>
<P><B>phallo</B>: see "phalloplasty"</P>
<P><B>phalloplasty</B>: Sometimes shortened to "phallo." A type of genital 
reconstruction surgery in which a phallus/penis is constructed from an 
individual's own donor tissue (usually taken from the forearm, leg, side of the torso, and/or 
abdomen) that has been shaped and grafted into place. Phalloplasty operations 
are usually done in stages requiring multiple surgeries. Scrotal implants may or 
may not be added. <A href="grs.html"></A><A href="grs.html">To learn more about 
phalloplasty and other kinds of genital reconstruction surgery, click here</A>. 
See also "genital reconstruction surgery."</P>
<P><B>Real Life Test (RLT)</B>: A period of time in which a trans person 
is required to live full time in the role of the sex they identify with (i.e., a 
trans person born female would be living full time as a male) before the 
medical community will begin steps in a medical gender reassignment process such as hormone therapy or surgeries. The RLT used to be required under some Standards of Care for the treatment of transsexuals; however,
 many mental health and medical professionals have moved away from this practice. See also "World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care (WPATH SOC)&quot; and "Standards of Care."</P>
<P><STRONG>sex change operation</STRONG>: see "sex reassignment surgery"</P>
<P><STRONG>sex reassignment surgery (SRS)</STRONG>: This term is somewhat of a misnomer, because it implies there 
is one surgical procedure for successful transition into presenting or living as 
male. For trans men, there are several surgical procedures available, including chest 
reconstruction surgery, hysterectomy/oophorectomy, and different types of 
genital reconstruction surgery (GRS). Many trans men undergo chest surgery, but not 
GRS. Many have chest surgery and a hysterectomy, but not GRS. Some have all 
three procedures (which may total more than three surgeries, as GRS can often 
involve several surgical procedures). Still others may not be able to afford any 
surgery at all, or choose not to have surgery for various reasons, yet live very successfully as men in society through ongoing 
testosterone treatment.</P>
<P>The requirements for "changing sex" under the law (i.e., changing one's 
legally recognized sex) vary from state to state, and often depend on the amount 
and type of surgery or hormone therapy one has had. A few states will not allow 
for a change in legal sex no matter how much surgery or treatment one has had. 
Thus, the idea that there is one clear-cut surgical solution for "changing sex" 
is a bit misleading. See also &quot;gender confirmation surgery (GCS),&quot; "chest surgery," "genital reconstruction surgery 
(GRS)," "hysterectomy," and "oophorectomy."</P>
<P><B>SOC</B>: see "Standards of Care"</P>
<P><B>SRS</B>: see "sex reassignment surgery"</P>
<P><B>Standards of Care (SOC)</B>: When someone uses the term "Standards of 
Care," they are often (but not always) referring to the WPATH SOC (formerly known as the Harry Benjamin Standards 
of Care, or HBSOC)-- a set of standards and guidelines used by 
professionals for the medical and mental health treatment of transsexuals. 
Certain health clinics and gender clinics have devised their own Standards of 
Care for transsexual and transgender people, which may differ from the WPATH SOC. 
See also "World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)&quot; and &quot;World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care (WPATH SOC).&quot;</P>
<P><B>STP device:</B> Short for "Stand to Pee" device. A device designed to aid 
the user in standing to pee at a urinal or toilet. There are a few different 
types of STP devices, both homemade and store-bought. <A href="bathroom.html">To 
learn more about STP devices, click here</A>.</P>
<P><B>stealth</B>: After a trans man has transitioned, he may choose not to reveal 
his trans status to those around him (for example, to coworkers, friends, 
neighbors, etc.); this is referred to as "going stealth" or "being stealth." 
</P>
<P><B>Sustanon</B>: The brand name for two formulas of injectable testosterone that contain a blend of esters. &quot;Sustanon 100&quot; contains three testosterone esters: testosterone propionate (C<SUB>22</SUB>H<SUB>32</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), testosterone phenylpropionate (C<SUB>28</SUB>H<SUB>36</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), and testosterone isocaproate (C<SUB>25</SUB>H<SUB>38</SUB>0<SUB>3</SUB>). &quot;Sustanon 250&quot; contains four testosterone esters: testosterone propionate (C<SUB>22</SUB>H<SUB>32</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), testosterone phenylpropionate (C<SUB>28</SUB>H<SUB>36</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), testosterone isocaproate (C<SUB>25</SUB>H<SUB>38</SUB>0<SUB>3</SUB>), and testosterone decanoate (C<SUB>29</SUB>H<SUB>46</SUB>0<SUB>3</SUB>). Both formulas feature both fast-acting and slow-acting esters, and can be injected anywhere from once every week to once every four weeks. Sustanon is prescribed outside of the United States. See also "esters." <A href="ttypes.html">To learn more about 
esters, and other types of testosterone, click here</A>.</P>
<P><B>top surgery</B>: see "chest surgery"</P>
<P><B>T</B>: see "testosterone"</P>
<P><B>testosterone</B>: Sometimes shortened to "T." An androgenic hormone 
responsible for producing masculine secondary sex characteristics such as facial 
hair growth, deepening of the voice, increased body hair growth, and increased 
muscle development. Testosterone therapy is administered to trans men to induce and maintain the 
presence of masculine secondary sex characteristics. <A 
href="hormonebasics.html">To learn more about hormones and the body, click 
here</A>. <A href="ttherapybasics.html">To learn more about testosterone therapy 
basics for FTM transsexuals, click here</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>testosterone gel</STRONG>: A form of testosterone applied directly to 
the skin on a daily basis. There are currently two brand-name versions of 
testosterone gel available in the United States: Androgel and Testim. Care must 
be taken to avoid skin-to-skin contact with a partner on the site of 
application. Transfer of the testosterone from the site can be prevented by 
keeping the area covered. <A href="ttypes.html">To learn more about testosterone 
gel and other forms of testosterone, click here.</A> See also "testosterone." 
</P>
<P><B>transgender</B>: Broadly speaking, transgender people are individuals 
whose gender expression and/or gender identity differs from conventional 
expectations based on the physical sex they were born into. The word transgender 
is an umbrella term which is often used to describe a wide range of identities 
and experiences, including: FTM transsexuals, MTF transsexuals, cross-dressers, drag queens, drag kings, 
genderqueers, non-binary gender identities, and many more. Because transgender is an umbrella term, it is imprecise and does not adequately describe the 
particulars of specific identities and experiences. (For example, the 
identity/experience of a post-operative FTM transsexual may  be very 
different from that of a female-identified drag king performer, 
but both are  included together under the term "transgender.")</P>
<P><B>trans</B>: Sometimes short for "transsexual," sometimes short for 
"transgender." See individual listings for those terms.</P>
<P><strong>trans man: </strong>Used to refer to those who were identified as/assigned female at birth and identify along a masculin or male spectrum.</P>
<P><B>transition</B>: The act(s) of changing from one sex to the other, and/or 
  the act(s) of changing one's physical body and/or appearance as part of a sex/gender 
  change. For most trans men, transition is not a single discrete event, but a gradual 
  set of changes over a period of time. As such, it is difficult to determine 
  exactly when transition begins and when it ends. Some feel that their transition 
  begins the day they begin hormone treatment. Some feel it begins when they tell 
  their loved ones about their identity. Some feel it begins when they change 
  their name legally to a male name. Some feel they are &quot;in transition&quot; 
  for a few years while hormonal changes settle in. Some feel that their transition 
  has officially ended when and if they are legally recognized as male. Some feel 
  their transition is complete when they have completed genital reconstruction 
  surgery. In short, what constitutes &quot;being in transition&quot; differs 
  among trans people.</P>
<P><B>transsexual</B>: An individual whose gender identity does not match the 
sex that was identified with/assigned to them at birth, and who usually seek 
hormonal and/or surgical treatment in order to bring their body into alignment 
with their gender identity. See also "gender identity." NOTE: The use of the term &quot;transsexual&quot; has fallen out of favor in recent years due to its strong links to the medicalization of trans identities. That said, there are still a percentage of trans people who prefer to identify with the term transsexual.</P>
