However, it is important   to note that many trans men do not avail themselves of the surgeries listed below   due to cost considerations, health reasons, or personal reasons. Currently,   most surgeries related to gender transition are not covered by insurance companies,   so costs can be prohibitive for many trans men of lower or fixed incomes.</p><p>FTM surgery is generally divided into three main groups:<br>  1. <b>Chest reconstruction surgeries</b> (also referred to as &quot;top&quot;   surgery or male chest contouring);<br>  2. <b>Hysterectomy</b> and <b>oophorectomy</b> (removal of the uterus and ovaries,   respectively); and<br>  3. <b>Genital reconstruction surgeries</b> (also referred to as &quot;lower&quot;   or &quot;bottom&quot; surgery or GRS).<br>  Within these three main groupings are different types of procedures and surgical   methods that will be further described herein.</p><p> This section describes the main types of <strong>genital reconstruction (GRS)   </strong> procedures that are currently available to trans men. <a href="chest.html">Chest   Surgery</a> and <a href="hysto.html">hysterectomy/oophorectomy</a> are detailed   in their own separate sections.</p><p>The descriptions of the FTM surgeries listed below are generalized. It is important  to note that each individual surgeon may use a different technique for any given  procedure. If you are considering any of these procedures, it is important to  research your options thoroughly and speak candidly with the surgeons you are  considering. That way, you can choose the procedure and surgeon that best suits  your body type, needs, and expectations.</p><hr><p><b><a name="meta"></a>Metoidioplasty<br>  </b>(Also sometimes spelled &quot;metaoidioplasty,&quot; a term meaning &quot;a   surgical change toward the male&quot;)<br>  <b> </b>Metoidioplasty--a surgical procedure developed in the 1970s--takes advantage   of the fact that ongoing testosterone treatment in a trans man typically causes his   clitoris to grow longer. The amount of clitoral growth varies with each individual,   but it is not uncommon to see an increase in size to about the length of one's   thumb. By cutting the ligament that holds the clitoris in place under the pubic   bone, as well as cutting away some of the surrounding tissue, the surgeon is   able to create a small phallus from the elongated clitoris. This is why metoidioplasty   is sometimes referred to as a &quot;clitoral free-up&quot; or &quot;clitoris   release&quot;-- the clitoris is freed from some of its surrounding tissue and   brought forward on the body in a manner that makes it appear like a small penis.   In order to further enhance the result, fat may be removed from the pubic mound   and skin may be pulled upward to bring the phallus even farther forward.</p><p>Metoidioplasty may also involve the creation of a scrotum (scrotoplasty) by   inserting testicular implants inside the labia majora, then joining the two   labia to create a scrotal sac. This is often done in two stages, where in the   first stage, tissue expanders are inserted in the labia in order to gradually   stretch the skin in preparation for the insertion of permanent testicular implants   at a later date. Some surgeons may insert the implants in the first procedure,   and join the two labia in a later procedure.</p><p>Metoidioplasty may additionally involve a urethral lengthening procedure to   allow the patient to urinate through the penis while standing. Surgeons may   employ tissue from the vaginal area or from inside the mouth/cheeks to create a urethral   extension. Usually, a catheter is placed inside the urethral extension for 2-3   weeks while the body heals and adapts to the new arrangement.</p><p>Depending on the surgeon and the desires/goals of the patient, the vaginal   cavity may or may not be closed or removed (this is typically referred to as   a &quot;vaginectomy,&quot; &quot;colpectomy,&quot; or &quot;colpocleisis&quot;). Often, a vaginectomy   is performed in conjunction with scrotoplasty and/or urethral lengthening.</p><p>The typical operating time for a metoidioplasty procedure is about 3-5 hours,   and may require additional follow-up procedures and revisions at a later date.   Time required may differ depending on the options chosen by the patient (i.e.,   if he chooses scrotal implants and/or urethral lengthening), as well as the   available tissue for the procedure, and the overall health and condition of   the patient. Recovery time is usually between 2 to 4 weeks of very limited activity.</p><p><strong>Pros, Cons, and Risks</strong><br>  The advantages of metoidioplasty are that it results in a natural looking (albeit   small), erotically sensate penis. Additionally, since the clitoris is made of erectile tissue,   the patient can achieve an unassisted erection when aroused. The procedure takes   advantage of existing genital tissue, and doesn't leave visible scars on other   parts of the body.</p><p>The disadvantages are that the resulting penis is usually quite small, and   as such often cannot be used for penetration. It also may not be a good choice   for a trans man whose clitoris has not grown substantially as a result of testosterone   therapy (most surgeons recommend being on testosterone therapy for at least   6 months to 2 years in order to maximize growth of the clitoris). And, as with   any surgery, there are potential risks of complication, such as the extrusion   of testicular implants, the formation of a stricture (an abnormal narrowing;   blockage) or fistula (an abnormal connection; leakage) in the newly constructed   urethral passage, and potential problems of infection and tissue death   (though tissue death is less common in metoidioplasty as compared to phalloplasty).   One must also consider the usual risks of any surgery, including bleeding, infection,   problems from anesthesia, blood clots, or death (rare). </p><p>Metoidioplasty procedures range in cost from about $2,000 (for clitoral release   only) to $20,000 (including urethral extension and testicular implants), and   perhaps more if hysterectomy/oophorectomy is performed at the same time. Fees   will vary among surgeons.</p><p>When considering a metoidioplasty procedure, it is important to research the   surgical options carefully and discuss them with the surgeons you are considering.   Each surgeon has a different approach and technique, and some may offer an array   of options, such as clitoris release only, different types of scrotoplasty or   urethral lengthening, etc. Also, if you are unsure if you wish to have additional   genital surgery (such as phalloplasty) in the future, discuss with your surgeon   which procedures will leave you with the most options for later surgery.</p><hr><p><b><a name="centurion"></a>Centurion<br>  </b>The Centurion procedure is a unique variation of metoidioplasty that was   first performed in 2002 by Dr. Peter Raphael. In the Centurion, the round ligaments   (which run along the sides of the labia) are freed from the labia majora and   brought together along the shaft of the clitoris to provide girth for the new   penis. The extraction of the round ligaments from the labia majora leaves a   hollowed-out area which serves as a &quot;pocket&quot; for solid silicone scrotal   implants. The labia major are later joined to form a scrotal sac. A urethral   extension to the tip of the new penis is formed by joining skin flaps around   a catheter that runs along the underside of the clitoris. The catheter remains   in place for about two weeks until the new urethral extension has healed.</p><p>The typical operating time for the Centurion procedure is about 2.5 hours;   if it is also being performed with vaginectomy and hysterectomy/oophorectomy,   the time increases to about 4-5 hours. The patient may require additional follow-up   procedures and revisions at a later date. Recovery time is usually between 2   to 4 weeks of very limited activity.</p><p><strong>Pros, Cons, and Risks</strong><br>  The advantages of the Centurion are that it results in a natural looking (albeit   small), erotically sensate penis. Since the clitoris is made of erectile tissue,   the patient can achieve an unassisted erection when aroused. The procedure takes   advantage of existing genital tissue, and doesn't leave visible scars on other   parts of the body.</p><p>The disadvantages are that the resulting penis is usually quite small, and   as such often cannot be used for penetration. It also may not be a good choice   for a trans man whose clitoris has not grown substantially as a result of testosterone   therapy (most surgeons recommend being on testosterone therapy for at least   6 months to 2 years in order to maximize growth of the clitoris). And, as with   any surgery, there are potential risks of complication, such as the extrusion   of testicular implants, the formation of a stricture (an abnormal narrowing;   blockage) or fistula (an abnormal connection; leakage) in the newly constructed   urethral passage, and potential problems of infection and tissue death   (though tissue death is less common in metoidioplasty/Centurion as compared   to phalloplasty). One must also consider the usual risks of any surgery, including   bleeding, infection, problems from anesthesia, blood clots, or death (rare).</p><p>When considering the Centurion or other metoidioplasty procedure, it is important  to research the surgical options carefully and discuss them with the surgeons  you are considering. Each surgeon has a different approach and technique. Also,  if you are unsure if you wish to have additional genital surgery (such as phalloplasty)  in the future, discuss with your surgeon which procedures will leave you with  the most options for later surgery.</p><hr><p><b><a name="phallo"></a>Phalloplasty<br>  </b>Phalloplasty involves the construction of a penis using donor skin from   other areas of the body. Depending on the type of phalloplasty procedure, skin   is typically taken from the abdomen, groin/leg,  forearm, and/or side of the upper torso (latissimus dorsi area) and grafted onto   the pubic area. Phalloplasty usually involves a urethral lengthening procedure   so that the patient can urinate through the penis. Erections are usually achieved   with either a malleable rod implanted permanently or inserted temporarily in   the penis, or with an implanted pump device.</p><p>Phalloplasty techniques vary widely from surgeon to surgeon. Updated and improved surgical techniques in recent years (such as microsurgical advances) have improved phalloplasty outcomes in recent years. Be sure to research   carefully the surgeons you are considering in order to get an exact account   of the procedure as they perform it. Summarized below are a number of terms   and procedures related to phalloplasty. Keep in mind that these descriptions   are generalized and are meant as a introduction to the topic; this list is not   necessarily exhaustive.</p><p><strong><a name="gillies"></a>Gillies technique</strong><br>  This refers to one of the earliest types of phalloplasty, in which a flap of   abdominal skin is rolled into a tube to create a flaccid penis. Over the years,   this procedure was improved to include a urethral extension by utilizing a second   section of abdominal skin wrapped &quot;raw side out&quot; to form a &quot;tube   within a tube,&quot; nested inside the constructed phallus. This method usually   produces a penis that is not erotically sensate (i.e., does not have feeling)   and is often not very realistic in appearance. Usually, a flexible rod must   be inserted into the penis in order to achieve an erection. The Gillies technique is now outdated, due to advances in microsurgical phalloplasty.</p><p><strong><a name="suitcase"></a>Suitcase handle</strong><br>  In order to help prevent tissue death in the penis, the Gilles procedure was    improved by the development of the &quot;suitcase handle&quot; technique,   where the rolled flap is left attached to the abdomen at the top and bottom   (like the handle of a suitcase) for a number of weeks in order to ensure a proper   blood supply. In a second stage operation, the flap (handle) is detached from   the top end, and that end is brought down to graft onto the genital area. It is   again allowed to develop a proper blood supply over a period of time. In a third operative stage,   the other end is detached from the abdomen, leaving the new penis to hang naturally   from its grafted place in the genital area. Variations of the suitcase handle technique are used in the pedicled flap procedures described below. Again, this type of phalloplasty is now outdated, due to advances in microsurgical phalloplasty.</p><p><strong><a name="pubic"></a>Pedicled pubic flap phalloplasty</strong><br>  In this procedure, the penis is constructed from an tubed pedicled flap running   from the pubic area to just underneath the belly-button. (The term &quot;pedicle&quot; here refers to the fact that the flap of donor skin is left attached to the body, as described in the suitcase handle technique, in order to improve proper blood supply and prevent tissue death). This procedure may   also utilize grafted skin from the thigh area to wrap around the outside of   the pedicle, mimicking the loose outer skin of the penis. A urethral extension   may by created using tissue from the labia or vaginal wall, or simply from creating   an &quot;inside-out&quot; inner tube from the donor area. This operation is   usually performed in several stages in order to ensure proper blood supply to the   pedicled flap. The clitoris is usually left intact near the base of the penis;   the exact placement of the base of the penis with regard to the clitoris should   be discussed with the surgeon. This method usually produces a penis that is   not erotically sensate. The aesthetic appearance of the penis is also sometimes   unrealistic. Usually, a flexible rod must be inserted into the penis or an implanted   pump device used in order to achieve an erection. </p><p>Because the donor skin used in this type of phalloplasty is typically hairy,   some patients may choose to undergo electrolysis in the donor areas for a period   of months to help minimize hair growth on the new penis. Indeed, some surgeons   require electrolysis of the donor areas before they will proceed with the procedure.   If electrolysis is not chosen, the patient will have to periodically shave the   skin of the penis or use depilatory cream.</p><p><strong><a name="groin"></a>Pedicled groin flap phalloplasty</strong><br>  This procedure is similar to the pedicled pubic procedure listed above, except   that it employs a skin flap that runs sideways outward from the groin area (usually   around the area where the upper thigh meets the pelvic bone). A urethral extension   may by created using tissue from the labia or vaginal wall, or simply from creating   an &quot;inside-out&quot; inner tube from the donor area. This operation is   usually performed in several stages in order to ensure proper blood supply to the   pedicled flap. The clitoris is usually left intact near the base of the penis;   the exact placement of the base of the penis with regard to the clitoris should   be discussed with the surgeon. This method usually produces a penis that is   not erotically sensate. The aesthetic appearance of the penis is also sometimes   unrealistic. Usually, a flexible rod must be inserted into the penis or an implanted   pump device used in order to achieve an erection.</p><p>Because the donor skin used in this type of phalloplasty can be hairy, some   patients may choose to undergo electrolysis in the donor areas for a period   of months to help minimize hair growth on the new penis. Indeed, some surgeons   require electrolysis of the donor areas before they will proceed with the procedure.   If electrolysis is not chosen, the patient will have to periodically shave the   skin of the penis or use depilatory cream.</p><p><strong><a name="ftft" id="ftft"></a>Free tissue flap transfer (FTFT)</strong><br>  The FTFT procedure is a more recent and improved approach to phalloplasty which uses a flap   of skin and tissue from the groin, thigh,  forearm, or upper torso area. In FTFT, a skin flap   is removed completely from the donor area and transferred, with its existing nerves and blood vessels intact, to the groin   area. There the flap's nerves and blood vessels are connected microsurgically   to the nerves and blood vessels of the groin. This is done with the aim of the   new penis becoming erotically sensate, while also helping to ensure proper blood   supply to the penis.</p><p><strong><a name="forearm"></a>Forearm free flap phalloplasty</strong><br>  This procedure is considered by many to produce a more realistic-looking, more   erotically sensate phallus than older phalloplasty procedures. This is due to   the nature of the skin of the forearm (areas on the underside of the forearm are of good consistency   and often are fairly hairless) as well as the nerves and blood vessels that   are able to be harvested with that skin. The main drawback to the procedure   is that it leaves a very large scarred area on the forearm, and there is some   risk of damage to the overall function and feeling of the arm. The donor   area on the arm is usually covered with skin from the thigh or groin, leaving   a secondary scar in that area as well. </p><p>The forearm skin is shaped into the new penis and grafted into place on the   groin, where the nerves and blood vessels are microsurgically connected. Some surgeons will connect the  brachial nerve of the forearm  to the pudendal nerve of the   clitoris (with the goal being erotic sensation in the penis). A urethra is   typically created using tissue from the labia, the inside of the mouth/cheeks, the vaginal wall, or with a   section of relatively hairless skin from the forearm donor site, shaped into   an inverted tube. The clitoris is usually left intact near the base of the penis;   the exact placement of the base of the penis with regard to the clitoris should   be discussed with the surgeon. Usually, a flexible rod must be inserted into   the penis or an implanted pump device used in order to achieve an erection.</p><p>Because the donor skin on the forearm can be hairy (depending on the patient   and the area from which the skin is taken), some patients may choose to undergo   electrolysis in the donor areas for a period of months to help minimize hair   growth on the new penis. Indeed, some surgeons require electrolysis of the donor   areas before they will proceed with the procedure. If electrolysis is not chosen,   the patient may have to periodically shave the skin of the penis or use depilatory   cream.</p><p><a name="modifiedforearm"></a><strong>Modified forearm free flap phalloplasty</strong><br>  In order to address the issue of major scarring on the forearm, some surgeons   have combined the benefits of forearm free tissue flap transfer with other methods   such as the pedicled groin flap. A surgeon may choose to create the main shaft   of the phallus from a non-sensate source such as a pedicled groin flap, but   in a later surgical stage, use sensate tissue from the forearm to create the   head of the penis. In another approach to minimize scarring, tissue expanders   may be inserted into the forearm and used over a period of months so that when   the tissue is harvested from the forearm, the donor area can be closed without   an additional skin graft. Such options should be carefully researched and discussed   with the surgeons you are considering.</p><p><a name="MLDflap" id="MLDflap"></a><strong>MLD flap phalloplasty</strong><br>   A recent advance in phalloplasty technique developed by Dr. S.V. Perovic uses an area of donor skin taken from the side of the upper torso, under the arm. This  is called a &quot;musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap,&quot; or &quot;MLD flap.&quot; One advantage of taking donor tissue from this area is that there is a less conspicuous scar than in the forearm flap procedure. Also, because the MLD flap donor area is a bit larger, this can allow for larger penis size if desired.</p><p>The MLD flap procedure is considered by many to produce a more realistic-looking, more erotically sensate phallus than older phalloplasty procedures. This is due to   the nature of the skin of the MLD flap (the donor area is often relatively hairless) as well as the nerves and blood vessels that are able to be harvested with that skin. Pre-surgical massage in the donor area is strongly recommended in order to increase skin elasticity and enable the surgeon to close the donor site directly. Patients who are obese may not have a successful or aesthetically pleasing outcome-- weight loss and/or lip suction may be required by a surgeon prior to performing this procedure.</p><p>The MLD flap phalloplasty is typically a three-stage procedure; 3-6 months recovery time is typically required between each stage. In the first surgical stage, skin from the donor area is shaped into the new penis and grafted into place on the   groin, where the nerves and blood vessels are microsurgically connected. The foundation for the new urethra is   also created during this stage using tissue from inside the mouth/cheeks. The second surgical stage finalizes the new urethra and connects it surgically with the native urethra. The third surgical stage involves implanting a  flexible rod  or a pump device that is used in order to achieve an erection.</p><p>Because the donor skin on the MLD flap can be hairy (depending on the patient), some patients may choose to undergo   electrolysis in the donor areas for a period of months to help minimize hair   growth on the new penis.  If electrolysis is not chosen,   the patient may have to periodically shave the skin of the penis or use depilatory   cream.</p><p><strong><a name="scrotoplasty"></a>Scrotoplasty</strong><br>  In general, the creation of the scrotum is usually accomplished by hollowing   out the labia majora, inserting solid silicone implants, and eventually joining   the labia to create a single scrotal sac (similar to the procedure used in <a href="#meta">metoidioplasty</a>).   However, other techniques are sometimes employed to create a scrotum, such as   the creation of a scrotal sac from donor tissue from the abdomen or thigh. Sometimes   fat is harvested from the pubic mound and transplanted into the constructed   sac rather than using implants, though often this does not produce adequate   size and symmetry.</p><p><strong><a name="procon"></a>Pros, Cons, and Risks</strong><br>  It is important to note that most phalloplasty procedures require multiple surgical   visits as well as some revisions. The procedures can involve pain and discomfort, require significant   recovery time, and often leave large areas of visible scarring. Because of the   nature of using skin grafts, there is always a risk of tissue death and loss   of part or all of the penis. Other potential complications include the extrusion   of testicular or penile implants, the formation of a stricture (an abnormal narrowing;   blockage) or fistula (an abnormal connection; leakage) in the newly constructed   urethral passage, and infection. There may also be damage to the nerves of the   donor area, resulting in numbness or loss of function. Erotic sensation may   be changed or diminished. And the results may not be as aesthetically pleasing   as one might like them to be. Also, one must consider the usual risks of any   surgery, including bleeding, infection, problems from anesthesia, blood clots,   or death (rare).</p><p>Phalloplasty procedures also tend to be very expensive (between $50,000 to   $150,000) and are often not covered by insurance.</p><p>However, if one desires an average-sized penis that looks acceptable in the   locker room, through which he can urinate, and with which he can engage in penetrative   sex, a phalloplasty is a way to achieve that end. Additionally, many   trans men do not feel complete without a penis, and so may pursue a phalloplasty   with that in mind. It is often reported by trans men that the forearm free flap phalloplasty   and the MLD flap phalloplasty provide the most realistic-looking penis of the options currently available,   if you are willing to accept the surgical risks.</p><hr><p><strong><a name="thoughts"></a>Thoughts to consider about genital reconstruction   surgery</strong><br>  If you are considering GRS, it is wise to research the available methods and   surgeons as much as possible, and keep an open mind about the things that are   important to you (sexual sensation, ability to urinate standing up, scarring,   aesthetics, size of penis, placement of penis, costs, etc.). Keep in mind that not all surgeons can perform all kinds of genital surgery, and often specific surgeons will specialize in their own surgical method. You may need to travel to another country to find a surgeon who specializes in the procedure you desire (though sometimes this can offer cost savings, depending on where your surgeon does the procedure).</p><p>If you have other genital or abdominal procedures done before your GRS (such   as hysterectomy/oophorectomy or vaginectomy), be sure to ask how the removal   of any tissues or resultant scarring might effect later GRS options. For example,   if you are having a metoidioplasty now but want to reserve the option of a future   phalloplasty, you may wish to inquire about whether vaginal/labial tissues should   be preserved for future use.</p><p>Whenever possible, ask to see photographic samples of surgeons' work, as well as statistical records. How many times have they performed a certain procedure? What have been the outcomes regarding post-surgical complications, patient satisfaction, and so on? If you   can see an example of their work that shows a patient with a similar body type   to yours, so much the better. There is a web site (<a href="http://www.transbucket.com/">www.transbucket.com</a><a href="http://www.transster.com"></a>)   that serves as a repository for FTM surgery photos and information. The site   can be searched by procedure type and by surgeon. Another good resource for   FTM surgical information and advice can be found on the FTM Surgery Info Group   on Yahoo (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmsurgeryinfo/">groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmsurgeryinfo</a>) and the FTM Phalloplasty Info Group   on Yahoo (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmphalloplastyinfo">groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmphalloplastyinfo</a>).   These can be invaluable resources when considering which surgeons and procedures   may be right for you. See also the <a href="#resources">resources</a> list below for further options.</p><hr><p><a name="presurgery"></a><b>Pre-surgical advice</b><br>  One of the main keys to an optimal surgical outcome is the overall health and   fitness of the patient going into surgery. Two factors that are often considered   important before a GRS procedure (besides overall good health) are smoking and   excess body weight. </p><p>Smoking slows the ability of the body to heal itself after surgery; thus, it   is usually recommended that patients who smoke avoid smoking for at least two   weeks prior to surgery, if at all possible. It is not necessary, but highly recommended.</p><p>As for the issue of excess body weight: while there is no reason why an individual   who is overweight cannot undergo surgery if he is otherwise healthy, for certain   procedures the aesthetic results may be more pleasing if an individual is near   their optimal body weight. However, if a patient cannot foresee losing weight   before the procedure, or simply chooses not to lose weight, he should be able   to proceed if he is in otherwise good health. Some surgeons are more willing   to work with patients with excess body weight than others. Speak to the surgeons   you are considering if you have weight concerns.</p><p>Other, specific pre-surgical advice will be provided to you by your surgeon.   Typically, you will be asked to discontinue use of aspirin, ibuprofen, and other   blood-thinning medications during the 10 days prior and up to the surgical date.   You may also be asked to discontinue use of other medications; be sure to discuss   any medications you are taking-- including supplements-- with your surgeon.</p><p>There are certain vitamins and supplements that are said to help benefit in   the healing process. You may wish to research this topic and outline a nutritional   regimen for both before and after surgery to aid your body's natural healing   process. However, taking supplements or vitamins is not necessary for a positive   surgical outcome.</p><p><strong><span class="style1">Was this page helpful to you?</span><br>Please consider <a href="donate.html">donating</a> to ftmguide.org! </strong></p><hr><p><strong><a name="resources" id="resources"></a>Resources</strong></p><p><strong>Transbucket</strong><br>  <a href="http://www.transbucket.com/">www.transbucket.com</a><a href="http://www.transster.com/"></a><br>Transbucket is a repository for images of FTM gender reassignment surgery results.
