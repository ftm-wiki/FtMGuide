<p><strong>The International Journal of Transgenderism</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.symposion.com/ijt/DEFAULT.htm">www.symposion.com/ijt/DEFAULT.htm</a><br>
  The IJT is peer reviewed, published quarterly and updated with new articles 
  during the quarter. IJT welcomes the submission of original scholarly articles 
  on any aspect of transgenderism from within any discipline. Articles submitted 
  are subject to the usual academic processes of anonymous peer review. The journal 
  also occasionally re-publishes previously published articles and books, which 
  are of significant interest, and which may not be readily available.</p>
