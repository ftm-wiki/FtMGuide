<p><a name="intro"></a><strong>Introduction<br>
</strong>In general, the term &quot;packing&quot; refers to the process of creating 
  a male-looking and/or feeling bulge in one's crotch-- specifically, it usually refers to &quot;soft 
packing,&quot; or wearing a device that mimics the appearance of a flaccid penis. <a href="packing.html">Click here for more information on soft packing</a>.</p>
<p>To &quot;pack hard&quot; refers to the wearing of a dildo or other prosthetic 
  device that is erect and may be used for sexual penetration. This section covers 
  some of the products that are currently available for use in sex play, as well 
  as methods for wearing such devices. There are numerous dildos/dicks and sex 
  toys on the market, and it is beyond the scope of this section to explore all 
  possible options. Rather, this section will focus mainly on devices that mimic 
  the look of a penis and testicles, as this is a concern for many trans men.</p>
<p>There are a few products that have been designed for &quot;dual use&quot; packing 
  (i.e., they can be packed fairly comfortably in everyday situations and can 
  also be used for penetrative sex). Such dual use, or &quot;pack and play&quot; packers and prosthetics are 
  also included below.</p>
<p>While reading this section, keep in mind that unless otherwise noted, the online sex toy stores listed 
  herein are trans male-friendly, and can help answer any specific questions you may 
  have about a particular product. Their stock may also vary at different times, 
  and the products available can sometimes change faster than I am able to update this Guide, so it pays to ask what else might be available if you aren't seeing quite what 
  you are looking for. </p>
<p>Finally, in this section I used the term dildo/dick to refer to store-bought 
  devices used for sex play. I use this term in recognition of the fact that many 
  trans men feel that these items are like an extension of their bodies, like a dick 
  and balls, but that when searching sex toy stores and catalogs, they are often 
  listed in the &quot;dildo&quot; section. I realize that there is no perfect 
  terminology to suit everyone-- hence the dual term.</p>

<p><strong><a name="types"></a>Different types of hard packers</strong><br>
  Numerous quality, affordable dildos/dicks have been developed in recent 
  years, with significant developments in realism and new materials occurring since the mid 1990s. Dildos/dicks can be made of a variety of different materials, sometimes out of 100% silicone (which is easy to clean and maintain), and sometimes out of other substances with names like &quot;elastomer,&quot; &quot;jelly,&quot; &quot;cyberskin,&quot;  &quot;flexoflesh,&quot; or &quot;UR3.&quot; There are also dildos made of very hard materials such as acrylic, glass, or lucite, but because these types of dildos are not realistic in regard to mimicking a penis, they are not discussed within this page. </p>
<p>For the purpose of this page, most of the realistic-looking dildos/dicks that a trans man might purchase will be divided into two main categories:<br>
  1. 100% silicone; and<br>
2. non-silicone or mixed-silicone materials (such as &quot;cyberskin,&quot; &quot;jelly,&quot; &quot;rubber,&quot; &quot;elastomer,&quot; &quot;soft vinyl,&quot; &quot;ultraskin,&quot; &quot;softskin,&quot; &quot;UR3,&quot; &quot;flexoflesh,&quot; and similar names) </p>
<p>Within those two very broad categories, there are numerous variations available, from inexpensive factory-molded products to professionally hand-crafted prosthetics; &quot;dual-use&quot; models; stand-to-pee packers modified for sex play; models with balls and without; models with flexible &quot;skins&quot; that mimic a penis in  texture; as well as different sizes, colors, and shapes.</p>
<p>When purchasing a dildo/dick, it is important to know what it is made of and how to care for and use it safely. The pros and cons of 100% silicone versus non-silicone or mixed-silicone products are described further below. </p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<p><b><a name="siliconebasics"></a>100% silicone: basics <br>
  </b> Silicone is a non-porous material that is chemically stable, durable, and hypoallergenic. Silicone dildos/dicks warm to body temperature, and  can vary in their firmness/density. Some silicone dildos/dicks are very firm, while other types are molded to feel more life-like (such as the &quot;VixSkin&quot; brand, the Tantus O2 line, and the Lola.Jake line of prosthetics), using a softer layer of silicone over a firmer core, 
  thus better mimicking the look and feel of a penis. </p>
<p>A big advantage of 100% silicone dildos/dicks is that they are easy to clean and can be sterilized by boiling in water 
  for 2-3 minutes. If you 
  have not had a chance to sterilize a silicone dildo/dick between uses or partners, 
  it is best to use a condom. Silicone dildos/dicks should also be regularly washed 
  with a mild soap and hot water, then rinsed and dried thoroughly before storing.</p>
<p>Another advantage of 100% silicone dildos/dicks is that, unlike many of the other &quot;realistic&quot; materials, there are no chemicals called &quot;phthalates&quot; used in their production. There is a great deal of controversy over the link of phthalates to possible health problems in humans, which is <a href="#phthalates">described further below</a>. While the health and environmental impact of phthalate use in dildos/dicks is unclear, many people may feel more confident using a 100% silicone product that is phthalate-free. </p>
<p>A disadvantage found in many silicone dildos/dicks that are currently on the market is that the coloring and detailing is often not as realistic as some of the non-silicone models. Another potential disadvantage with silicone is that quality and hand-made products can be expensive compared to certain non-silicone models such as rubber or jelly. </p>
<p>Silicone is generally quite durable, but care should be taken to avoid breaking or tearing the surface of a silicone dildo/dick. Once a crack 
    has formed, silicone can tear quite easily-- this can especially be an issue near the base of the shaft near the opening of a harness or pants-fly. If an O-ring is too tight or if rough edges (like a zippered fly) come into continued contact with the dildo/dick, it can cause a tear. Silicone lubricants should not be 
    used with silicone dildos/dicks, as this will degrade them over time. If you are using pre-lubricated condoms over your silicone toy, look for a condom that specifies a water-based lubricant, as many condom manufacturers now use silicone lubricants.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="nonsiliconebasics"></a>Non-silicone or mixed-silicone materials: basics </strong><br>
The category of &quot;non-silicone&quot; or &quot;mixed-silicone&quot; dildos/dicks encompasses a variety of  different soft plastics and rubber materials, and sometimes may be a mixture of silicone and soft plastics. The manufacturers of many of these products are not always clear about what materials have gone into making them. Similar-sounding names (&quot;cyberskin&quot; versus &quot;ultraskin&quot;) may or may not indicate the same list of ingredients in any given dildo/dick.  Other product names may include &quot;jelly,&quot; &quot;rubber,&quot; &quot;elastomer,&quot; &quot;soft vinyl,&quot; &quot;cyberskin,&quot; &quot;ultraskin,&quot; &quot;softskin,&quot; &quot;UR3,&quot; &quot;flexoflesh,&quot; and other unique names.</p>
<p>Terms like &quot;cyberskin,&quot; &quot;ultraskin,&quot; &quot;softskin,&quot; &quot;flexoflesh,&quot; and &quot;UR3&quot; are used to describe materials that may feel more soft and lifelike than traditional silicone dildos/dicks. The specific term used will generally depend on the manufacturer and/or the store selling the item. Sometimes these items feature a firmer core and a softer cyber/ultra/softskin outer layer. The look of these products can be incredibly realistic in color and detailing, and some mimic the feeling of skin better than their silicone counterparts. </p>
<p>In general, all non-silicone or mixed-silicone dildos/dicks are made of porous materials, and thus they can easily pick up dirt and 
  bacteria. Unlike 100% silicone dildos/dicks, they <strong>cannot</strong> be boiled for sterilization purposes, as this would melt or otherwise damage the material. Such dildos/dicks should be used with condoms during any kind of sex play, especially if you plan on changing partners in the future. They should be washed frequently 
with mild soap and warm water, rinsed well, and patted dry. Keeping non-silicone and mixed-silicone materials clean 
will help maintain their texture and quality, which (unlike 100% silicone) will degrade over time. Their color and detailing may also fade with time. While in storage, some non-silicone dildos/dicks will leave behind a greasy residue, and some will degrade rapidly if they come in contact with different sex toys or other materials. You may wish to store each of these items separately in a plastic bag. </p>
<p>Certain types of &quot;cyberskin&quot; or &quot;gel&quot; material have a tacky/sticky feeling after cleaning and drying, and you may wish to dust their surface lightly with cornstarch to keep them from collecting dirt and lint. Check with the store where you bought the dildo/dick for specific care instructions. <strong>Do not</strong> use talcum powder for this purpose, as there is some evidence that the use of talcum powder is linked to cervical cancer.</p>
<p>In addition to their inability to be sterilized, another   disadvantage is that chemicals called &quot;phthalates&quot; are often used in the production of non-silicone dildos/dicks (there are exceptions to this-- some toys are touted as phthalate free). There is a great deal of controversy over the link of phthalates to possible health problems in humans, which is <a href="#phthalates">described further below</a>. While the impact of phthalate use in dildos/dicks is unclear, some users feel more confident using a 100% silicone product that is phthalate-free. Also, as mentioned above, many non-silicone and mixed silicone materials tend to degrade over time, sometimes leaving a &quot;greasy&quot; residue behind on surfaces they touch. For  these reasons, it is recommended that you use condoms with non-silicone and mixed silicone products.</p>
<p>Some newer dildos/dicks incorporate silicone as one ingredient in order to decrease some of the negatives of non-silicone. A mixed-silicone/soft plastic combination may decrease the overall level of phthalates and increase durability; however, it will still be porous and will not have the same ability to be sterilized as 100% silicone.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of material, non-silicone or mixed silicone may be less expensive or comparably priced to 100% silicone models.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="procon"></a>Summary: pros and cons of 100% silicone versus non-silicone/mixed silicone</strong></p>
<p>100% SILICONE<br>
  Pros: Durable, easy to clean, non-porous, can be sterilized between users, does not contain phthalates, chemically stable: does not degrade appreciably over time.<br>
Cons: Color, detailing, and &quot;skin&quot; feel are sometimes not as realistic, may be more expensive than certain rubber and jelly models </p>
<p>NON-SILICONE and MIXED-SILICONE<br>
  Pros: Color, detailing, and &quot;skin&quot; feel are sometimes more realistic than silicone models, certain rubber and jelly models are comparatively cheaper <br>
Cons: Porous, cannot be sterilized between users, may contain phthalates, materials, color, and detailing degrade over time, can leave a &quot;greasy&quot; residue, materials used in manufacture are often unknown</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>

<p><a name="phthalates"></a><strong>A note about phthalates<br>
</strong>Phthalates are chemicals that have been used in industry for many decades. They are used for a variety of purposes, including making PVC plastic flexible, as well as for softening other plastic materials. They are also used as fixatives for perfume, additives for making nail polish flexible, and for countless other purposes including  cosmetics and personal care products, medical products, automotive parts, clothing, and more. In the sex toy industry, phthalates are used in the manufacture of many soft, flexible, non-silicone dildos, vibrators, and other soft plastic products.</p>
<p>There is a great amount of controversy over whether exposure to the phthalates found in various products is safe for humans (or for animals and the ecosystem in general). In recent years, a large focus of concern has been around the potential effect of phthalates on the endocrine system and in reproductive development. Some scientists and environmental organizations have hypothesized that phthalates may act as &quot;endocrine disrupters&quot; in humans and animals, and may cause unwanted estrogenic or anti-androgenic effects. Animal studies have linked phthalates to negative effects on male reproductive development in laboratory rats, but definitive conclusions about such effects on human reproductive development have yet to be determined. A recent study in humans (&quot;Decrease in Anogenital Distance among Male Infants with Prenatal Phthalate Exposure,&quot; by Swann, et al., Environmental Health Perspectives, 2005 August; 113(8): 1056&ndash;1061) demonstrated a significant relationship between a mother's exposure to environmental levels of phthalates during pregnancy and effects on male reproductive system development in baby boys. However, there is considerable disagreement on this topic, and  additional study of human data will be required in order to better understand the relationship between phthalates and human reproductive health.</p>
<p>Its should be noted that most studies on health effects of phthalates focus on exposure to the chemicals through ingestion (via the mouth), inhalation (breathing), transdermal transfer (through the skin), or transfer during medical procedures (such as a blood transfusion through plastic tubing). There seems to be little or no consideration about exposure via sex toy use. Additionally, because sex toys are considered &quot;novelty&quot; items, their manufacture goes largely unregulated and unmonitored. According to the Canadian Broadcasting Company's web site, German chemist Hans Ulrich Krieg analyzed phthalate concentrations in sex toys, and found them to be very high compared to other consumer products. Because the materials used in making sex toys are usually not listed, the consumer has no way of knowing exactly what chemicals they may contain and at what levels.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean for the buyers of sex toys? Because the long-term health effects of phthalate exposure are unknown, most reputable sex toy stores recommend the use of condoms as a protective barrier when using non-silicone dildos and toys for vaginal, anal, and oral sex. In general, this is already recommended practice because virtually all soft, non-silicone items are also porous and therefore cannot be sterilized between uses. Some sex shops  have discontinued the sale of  products that contain phthalates until their health effects are better understood. Others continue to sell them because many of the cyberskin, ultraskin, and softskin options offer greater variety and enhanced realism for their customers. Most recommend condom use with these products as a precaution. A few reputable manufacturers strive to create sex toys out of quality materials; if you are concerned about what your toys are made of, ask questions-- many of the shops included on this site will be very helpful and are knowledgeable about all the products they sell. </p>

<p><b><a name="tips"></a>Some general tips on use <br>
</b>Each individual's body is different, so how well any particular device works 
  will depend on the people using it (both the wearer and the partner). In general, 
  the variables that can be controlled to make the use of a dildo/dick more pleasurable 
  for you and your partner are:</p>
<p>1. the overall size/shape of the dildo/dick (diameter, length, contour, texture)<br>
  2. the firmness of the dildo/dick<br>
  3. the angle of penetration (this can be effected by both the angle/curve of 
  the dick itself and also by sexual position)<br>
  4. the amount of control allowed by the method used to wear the dildo/dick (i.e. 
  does the harness fit well, does the harness or other attachment method hold the dick firmly, does the ring in the 
  harness allow for good fit around the shaft or balls, etc.)<br>
  5. lubrication<br>
  6. practice and communication</p>
<p>As a general rule, increasing lubrication can help if a dildo/dick is not very 
  firm. Be sure to choose a lubricant which is compatible with both the dildo/dick 
  and a condom if you are using one. One should look for a harness or other hard 
  packing method that is both comfortable and holds the dildo/dick firmly at the 
  base so that it allows for maximum control of motion. If a dildo/dick has balls, 
  a harness should be chosen that can accommodate it for best fit. And-- obviously-- 
  size, shape and positioning can be adjusted according to your own body as well 
  as your partner's body. For example, a guy with a big belly might choose a slightly 
  longer dick because his angle of penetration might not be the same as a guy 
  with a flat belly. Or, a guy might choose a smaller or larger dick depending 
  on his partner's needs.</p>
<p>For those who want sales advice, the sex stores listed below offer trans male-friendly 
  tips and information about dildo/dick and harness use.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>

<p><strong><a name="silicone"></a>100% silicone dildos/dicks: product listings</strong><br>
  There are a number of silicone dildos/dicks that are modeled to provide a look 
  that is life-like in appearance and color-- some are more successful in that 
  endeavor than others. Vixen Creations has made progress in creating a softer skin-like outer layer on their &quot;VixSkin&quot; products, for example, and many of the products listed in the prosthetics section have made amazing strides in realism. </p>
<p>Because of the wide variance in the people who use dildos, 
  there is a wide variance in their size, shape, and appearance. For the most 
  part (unless otherwise noted), I have included models that mimic the look of 
  a penis, while also trying to allow for some variety in size 
  and shape. Also, keep in mind that some silicone models are available with balls, 
  but many are not-- this is partly due to the fact that models with balls are 
  sometimes harder to use with certain harnesses. The online retailers offer photos 
  of the products listed below; I have noted below which models feature balls 
  and which do not.</p>
<p>To make organization of this section a bit easier, I have divided it by online 
  retailer. The online retailers I have included herein 
  include: <a href="http://www.toolshedtoys.com">The Tool Shed</a> of Milwaukee,  <a href="http://www.early2bed.com">Early to Bed</a> of Chicago, and <a href="http://www.smittenkittenonline.com/">The 
  Smitten Kitten</a> of Minneapolis. I've included listings from these shops because they have good online stores and because they are positive and affirming of diversity 
  in gender and sexuality. You may have a different store that is local to you that offers similar products, and may be able to special order items seen here. </p>
<p>Some of the products you see below may be listed by 
    more than one store, and prices may vary slightly from store to store. Some 
    stores also seem to measure the size of dildos/dicks slightly differently, but 
    in general you should be able to get a good idea of the products by checking 
    their web sites and asking questions for further detail on size, firmness, exact 
    color, etc.</p>
<p>Measurements listed indicate insertable length for the first number, and diameter 
  of the shaft (usually measured at its widest point) for the second number (i.e., 
  a 6&quot; x 1 1/2&quot; model would be 6 inches in length and one-and-a-half 
  inches in diameter).</p>

<p><strong><a name="cyberskin"></a>Non-silicone and mixed-silicone dildos/dicks: product listings <br>
</strong>Non-silicone and mixed silicone products will vary in their firmness, texture, realism, and overall quality depending on what material they are made of. I have included the material description as listed by the online resellers below.</p>
<p>Because of the wide variance in the people who use dildos, there is a wide variance in their size, shape, and appearance. For the most part (unless otherwise noted), I have included models that mimic the look of a penis. Most of these products are made with balls, and it is noted below if they are 
  not. Unfortunately, a number of the cyber/ultra/softskin options are only available 
  in a pinkish color shade, which is not appropriate for those of darker skin. 
  If you have questions about color availability, be sure to ask the online retailers 
listed below.</p>
<p>To make organization of this section a bit easier, I have divided it by online retailer. The online retailers I have included herein include: <a href="http://www.toolshedtoys.com">The Tool Shed</a> of Milwaukee and <a href="http://www.early2bed.com">Early to Bed</a> of Chicago. I've included listings from these shops because they have good online stores and because they are positive and affirming of diversity in gender and sexuality. You may have a different store that is local to you that offers similar products, and may be able to special order items seen here.</p>
<p>These products should be used with a condom, as they are porous and will easily pick up dirt and bacteria. Be sure to follow all care instructions that come with the dildo/dick of your choice.</p>

<p><strong><a name="dualuse"></a>Dual-use packers: product listings </strong><br>
  There are a few products that have been designed for &quot;dual-use&quot; (i.e., 
  they can be packed fairly comfortably in everyday situations and can also be 
  used for penetrative sex). See also the dual-use/&quot;pack and play&quot; devices in the &quot;<a href="#prosthetics">prosthetics</a>&quot; 
  section.</p>
<p>If you are anticipating sexual activity, having a dual-use packer available 
  can be quite helpful. However, if you plan any vigorous motion, you'll probably 
  have to wear these type packers with a harness. You also may want to use lubricant 
  with these packers, as they tend to be a bit less firm than their dildo/dick 
  counterparts. Many of these models have inner rods that are bendable, so that the wearer can change the angle when going from pack to play. Use caution during vigorous play, as it is possible for the inner rod to break through the surface of the toy, which could cause injury.</p>
<p>For general day-to-day packing, wearing dual-use packers may not be very comfortable,
  and may also look and feel somewhat unrealistic. Use you judgment when considering
  these packers-- they might not be the best for everyday wear.</p>

    <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/new-york-toy-collective-shilo.html">www.toolshedtoys.com</a> <br>
The New York Toy Collective's Shilo is made with a bendable inner rod running the length of the shaft, allowing the wearer to bend it up, down, or to the side while in everyday packing situations. Shilo is made from a soft, skin-like silicone, and it has a very pronounced head with a veined shaft. Optional testicles (the <a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/new-york-toy-collective-love-bump-balls-attachment.html">Love Bump</a>) can be purchased with the Shilo in matching skin tones from the same soft silicone. The inner rod is quite durable, and there is little danger of it poking through the shaft due to how the Shilo is made. Diameter: 1.3125&quot; (head with is 1.75&quot; at widest point), length is 6.5&quot; (6&quot; insertable length), Available in 4 skin tones: cashew, caramel, hazelnut, and chocolate. $145 ($35 for Love Bump)</p>

    The Hugo and Tomas are both STP-compatible, 3-in-1 realistic silicone prosthetics. The difference between the Hugo and the Tomas is that the Tomas is hand-painted with 9 layers of extrinsic silicone color &amp; skin tones to give finely  sculptured skin details. Hugo is produced in a solid skin tone, but still has the sculpted details of veins and skin folds. Both Hugo and Tomas are fitted with a removable flexible, jointed hard plastic insert  for use during sexual play. During everyday packing, that insert is  removed to create the feel of a flaccid penis. The shaft is hollowed to  allow for use as a Stand-To-Pee packer. You can use the flexible blue  silicone STP funnel included with the Hugo or Tomas, or you can add your own  removable funnel device that might work better with your body. The hollowed area  behind the balls will work with most STP funnel devices. </p>

  FreeToM Prosthetics is a transgendered medical prosthesis manufacturing company located in  Portland, Oregon. Using high quality materials and techniques, each prosthetic is carefully handmade and is unique-- they are molded from volunteer cis males for extra realism. All their prosthetics are made from 100% silicone, are easy to clean and are offered in multiple skin tones. They offer a number of models, from a very realistic looking &quot;Buddy&quot; packer ($89), to an STP pack-and-pee ($219), to multi-use models for packing, peeing, and sexual play (4 sizes available range from $198 to $220). Generally, these prosthetics are <strong>not</strong> designed to be glued in place.</p>
<p><strong>Pee-Cock 3-in-1 Packer</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.peecockproducts.com">www.peecockproducts.com</a><br>
  This product, introduced in 2011, is designed to be a stand-to-pee packer and pack-and-play model all in one. Made of soft silicone, the shaft of the Pee-Cock has an opening throughout its length to allow for urination. The opening through the shaft also can accommodate a flexible &quot;erection rod&quot; that is inserted through the back of the packer to allow the Pee-Cock to be used for sexual penetration. The back of the packer is shaped like the opening of a funnel; it is pressed low and tightly against the body over the urethral opening during urination. Due to the shape of the funnel, the Pee-Cock may also work well for men who have had metoidioplasty.</p>
<p>The Pee-Cock comes in three sizes, 4 inches ($129), 5.5 inches ($139), and 6.5 inches ($149). They are in the flaccid state when worn without the erection rod. There are 3 shades of skin tones available: caucasian, moderate brown or dark brown. Pee-Cock Products also offers two harnesses to wear with the Pee-Cock.</p>
<p><strong>Like Real Prosthetics</strong><br>
  <a href="http://like-real-us.com">like-real-us.com</a><br>
  The professionally-made prosthetics offered on the Like Real site include both flaccid and erect models that are designed to be attached to the body with medical adhesive. A number of the flaccid models are equipped with an STP urination system that is built into the packer (the erect models do not have a urination system). There are flaccid models featuring the appearance of uncut foreskin, as well as circumcized models, and they offer a choice of 5 skin tone options. The detailing is quite realistic, and you can view videos of most products to see multiple views. Like Real also offers the medical adhesive and adhesive remover needed to wear the packers affixed to the skin. Prices range from around $200 to just over $700, and they do sell sets that include both flaccid and erect prosthesis.</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.tyron2.net/">www.tyron2.net</a><br>
  The creator of the Project, based in Germany, began 
  working with silicones and plastics in order to create a realistic, durable, and comfortable prosthetic for trans men. As a trans man himself, he became 
  aware of some of the limitations of other prosthetic products, and has attempted 
  to address those in the Project's development.</p>
<p>The site offers a product called &quot;Phase 4&quot;--a 
  very realistic-looking dick and testicles that can be worn both flaccid and erect. It is designed to be attached with <a href="#adhesive">medical adhesive</a> at both the  pelvis and at a very small area just below the tailbone. The prosthetic can become erect if you desire by pumping the balls until the shaft reaches full length and desired hardness. A release valve returns the prosthetic to its flaccid state. The shaft is designed to lay naturally when flaccid. </p>
<p>The flaccid size is about 4 inches long, and the erect size is about 6.5 inches long. The skin on the shaft and scrotum are soft and flexible move freely when touched. 9 different skin tones are available. Bluish veins can be seen and felt when erect, but not when flaccid. The prosthetic is made of silicone, and can be boiled to disinfect. </p>
<p>Phase 4 comes with a care guide (available in English or German), and the cost is 1,209 Euro. The site does not sell adhesives, but provides recommendations for where to purchase them.

<p>These prosthetics are designed to be attached to the pubic area with <a href="#adhesive">medical adhesive</a>. But they can also be worn in the packing harnesses <a href="#harnesses">listed below</a>.</p>
<p> The flaccid models include small, mid, and large (approximately 3 inches, 4 inches, and 5 inches, respectively), and examples can be seen on the web site. They can be made with or without foreskin. They are made from silicone on the exterior and filled with a special gel so that the prosthesis is soft to the touch and will squash slightly when squeezed. All sizes are AU$730.00.</p>
<p>The dual-use prosthesis is hard enough for penetration, but soft enough for daily wear. It hangs down so that is does not create too much of a bulge. This model can be purchased with or without testicles. The model with testicles has a flexible implant in the core, so that you can bend it upward for penetration. The regular-size dual model is 5 inches in length, and the large size is 6 inches in length. The regular dual model without testicles is AU$1260; with testicles is AU$1400. The large dual model comes with testicles and is AU$1500.</p>

Base prices start at $329.99 and go up to $579.99, with additional fees for custom options. Please note: because these prosthesis are relatively long, they may not be suitable for smaller or average size men for everyday, flaccid packing purposes.</p>

<p><strong><a name="harnesses"></a>Harnesses and other methods for packing hard<br>
  </strong>There are a few creative ways to pack a dildo/dick for sex without 
  the use of a harness. For very vigorous movement, however, a harness offers 
you the maximum amount of control.</p>
<p><strong>Non-harness hard packing methods</strong><br>
  If you find yourself in a situation where you do not have a harness handy, or 
  just don't wish to break the mood by having to get up and change into one, the 
  following methods may work:</p>
<p>1. If you are wearing button-fly pants, you can button the fly snugly around 
  the base of the dildo/dick to hold it in place (some dildos/dicks are better 
  suited for this than others, depending on the width of the base). If you also 
  place the dick through the fly of your boxer shorts or briefs and then through 
  the fly of the pants, this will add extra stability. <strong>Do not</strong> 
  try this method with a zipper fly, as it may damage the dildo/dick and cause 
  it to tear.</p>
<p>2. Wear two or three pairs of briefs and bring the shaft of the dildo/dick 
  through each successive fly front. The disadvantage of this method is that it 
  may be very warm and bulky. Wearing a looser pair of boxer shorts over the briefs can mask the appearance of the briefs and give more natural, less bunched look.</p>
<p>3. Certain specially-made, <a href="#prosthetics">prosthetic dicks</a> can be attached directly to the skin using 
  medical-grade adhesive; this should only be done with prostheses that have been 
designed specifically for such use.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
<p><strong>Choosing a Harness</strong><br>
  For optimal control of motion and so that you may move vigorously during sex, 
  a harness is your best bet. When looking for a harness to go with your hard 
  packer, it is important to find one that fits both your body and the dildo/dick. 
  This is of particular importance if you have chosen a dildo/dick with balls. 
  Some harnesses are less compatible with balls; you should inquire about the 
  best choice in harness for the dick you have chosen.</p>
<p>Harness fit and effectiveness will also depend on body shape and personal preference. Some heavier guys 
  find that wearing a harness that keeps the dildo/dick placed higher up helps them maintain comfort and control. Others may find that T-strap/g-string harnesses, with a single strap that runs between the butt cheeks, offers them more control. But not everyone likes the feel of T-strap/g-string harnesses (plus they are much harder to use with dildos/dicks with balls). Jock-strap/two-strap style harnesses (with two 
    straps going around the legs) tend to work better with balls, and some find they offer better fit, control, and feel. This may 
    be something you find out for yourself through trial and error. Again, it is 
    wise to ask the salespeople at the online retailers listed herein for their 
  advice as to fit and function given your needs and body type. </p>
<p>If you plan to use a variety of dildos/dicks, you may wish to look into a harness 
  that allows you to change the size of the &quot;O-ring&quot; that holds the 
  base of the dildo/dick. Some harnesses allow for quick O-ring change by simply 
  unsnapping small straps, while others have an O-ring sewn in so that it cannot 
  be changed. If you do choose a model with a permanently sewn-in O-ring, be sure that is fits your dildo/dick appropriately.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to choose a design and material that feels comfortable 
  on your body. </p>
<p>This site does not list all possible harness options; rather, the focus is 
  on models that are appropriate for use with dildos/dicks with balls, have adjustable O-rings, or have some other relevant or unique design feature. Leather and non-leather options are listed. Some retailers offer the same harness model but describe the waist-sizes differently, which is reflected in the descriptions below. Some retailers also offer different sizes and colors of the same model. </p>

Waist sizes: 26"-28", 29"-32", 33"-37", 38"-40", 41"-44", 45"-48", 49"-52", 51"-56", 57"-60"</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.toolshedtoys.com/search/rodeoh/?brand=106093">RodeoH Underwear-style Harness</a> </strong><br>
These 95% cotton/5% elastene briefs-style underwear have  a 1.5&quot; waistband and a sewn-in 1.5&quot; diameter O-ring. The O-ring stretches a little bit-- RodeoHs are best used with dildos/dicks that are between  1.5&quot;-1.875&quot; in diameter. RodeOhs are also most effective with dildos/dicks between 4&quot;-6&quot; length-- the weight of longer dildos/dicks may cause the package to droop forward somewhat. Because RodeOhs are like underwear, they are easy to slip on and off, and are machine washable. Available in waist sizes 23&quot;-24&quot;, 25&quot;-26&quot;, 27&quot;-29&quot;, 30&quot;-32&quot;, 33-35&quot;, 36&quot;-38&quot;, 39&quot;-41&quot;, 46&quot;-49&quot;, 52&quot;-55&quot;<br>
Colors vary!  </p>

<p><strong><a name="adhesive"></a>Medical Adhesive for prosthetics</strong><br>
  Some silicone prosthetics can be 
  attached to the skin with a medical-grade adhesive. Please note that adhesives 
  should not be used with dildos/dicks that haven't been designed for such use.<br>
  <br>
  Basic Instructions for using Medical Adhesive for your prosthesis:<br>
  1. Shave the area where the prosthesis is to be attached.<br>
  2. Apply a thin layer of adhesive to the back of the prosthesis (where it will
  only come into contact with the pubic area).<br>
  3. Wait until the adhesive begins to dry (this should take 1 to 2 minutes).<br>
  4. Press the prosthetic firmly onto the pubic area<br>
  5. Hold in place for 60 seconds.<br>
  6. Apply a new layer of adhesive or as needed.<br>
  7. Use appropriate removal solvent with a cotton ball to remove adhesive.</p>
<p>Medical adhesive and solvent can be purchased from the maker the <a href="http://www.ftmprosthetics.com/">FTM Prosthesis</a>, 
  or can be bought from a prosthetics supplier such as <a href="http://www.factor2.com/">Factor 
  II, Inc</a>.</p>
